# Encyclopedia of Orthodox Military Putinism: The “Golden Dozen” Dossier

#### **Diagnostic Foreword: Satire as a Method of Political Autopsy**

Conventional political analysis often fails when confronted with the **performative absurdity** and **metaphysical cynicism** of the contemporary Russian regime. Where rational discourse reaches its limit, **clinical satire** becomes the essential diagnostic tool.

This project is not a literary exercise. It is a **systematic cartography of a political necrosis**— a regime that has evolved from post-Soviet authoritarianism into a unique hybrid: **Orthodox Military Putinism**. This ideology synthesizes imperial nostalgia, perverted religious symbolism, and hyper-modern surveillance into a doctrine of perpetual war — against its own citizens, against historical truth, and against the very concept of objective reality.

The “Golden Dozen” dossier presented herein dissects four core pathologies of this system:

1.  **The Biopolitics of Expendability:** The conceptual reduction of the population—especially its youth — from citizens to **consumable “bio-resources”**, valued only for their utility in sustaining power and fueling conflict.
2.  **The Engineering of Unreality:** The regime’s primary operational technology is not merely propaganda, but **institutionalized gaslighting**—the systematic weaponization of absurdity to collapse critical thought and moral judgment.
3.  **The Sacrilege of Faith:** The strategic co-option and mutation of the Russian Orthodox Church into a **theological arm of the security state**, providing sacred sanction to war and repression.
4.  **The Algorithm of Chaos:** A detailed schematic of how the Kremlin exports not just influence, but a **ready-to-install “software for autocracy”** — a package of hybrid tactics, ideological viruses, and corrupt governance models designed to destabilize and replicate.

Below you will find **The Golden Dozen** — twelve key diagnostic miniatures. They serve as both a diagnostic introduction and a conclusive proof of concept.

## 1. THE SUPERNOVUS COVENANT

![](Images/En_Album_45.jpg)

1. Love your Putin with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your soul.
2. Love your neighbor: your boss, your deputy, your tax inspector.
3. Thou shalt not kill — a statesman, a law enforcement officer.
4. Thou shalt not commit adultery in a condom.
5. Do not bear false witness for personal gain — only for the good of the Motherland.
6. Do not waste thy seed — make children.
7. Thou shalt not steal — that is the prerogative of state officials.
8. Do not seek treasures on earth — they have already been appropriated.
9. Whoever speaks ill of Volodin or Matvienko is worthy of death.
10. Do not yield to the devilish temptation of foreign agents and the fifth column.
11. Blessed are the informers, for theirs is the earthly kingdom. Denounce — and you shall be heard.
12. Love your Motherland — especially through government contracts.
13. Abstain from doubt: faith in television shall save you.
14. Avoid the words “freedom” and “peace,” for they are heresy.
15. Thou shalt not make idols outside the power vertical.

May loyalty be with you — and ye shall not perish in prison.

*From the “Revelation of Russian agency for communications control,” ch. 666.*

## 3. ONE HEAD FOR CROWN, THE OTHER RULES THE COUNTRY

![](Images/En_Album_59.jpg)

*Note: Illustration blocked by censorship.*

Spacious conference hall. Officials  seated inside. On illuminated stage well-known political leader lies on his back. His genitals fully exposed; his erect penis crowned with miniature, yet precise, copy of his own head. Small head of lying politician addresses audience with loud, pompous speech:

— The birth rate in the country is falling catastrophically. Like a stone dropped into an abyss. I've been long saying it and I repeat: condoms and abortions are to blame for everything! And LGBT. And Childfree. We must fight, fight, and fight against all this heresy. So far, we are doing poorly.

We banned abortions. So what? Now they go to China to have abortions. Or they give birth in Argentina and stay there for ever. Condoms are the utmost evil. Condoms are a personal insult to me. They violate the basic right of the individual — the right to procreate and multiply. Enshrined in the Constitution, by the way.

We banned condoms having named them  symbols of  extremism. So what? The black market for condoms is thriving. Underground manufactories of rubber goods are springing up like mushrooms after rain. All over the country. LGBT propaganda is oozing out of every crack. What is happening? This is a complete failure of my decrees implementation. I will not put up with this attitude.

If the state apparatus cannot force the population to give birth — I will force the state apparatus to give birth.

Turn on your brains, if any.
And start working.

Do we not have a sperm bank? Do we not have an egg bank?
Buy eggs from the population at a fixed price. Introduce a natural tax, for god's sake— one egg per month in favor of the state.

Engage the Academy of Sciences — let them create a state military Incubator. We will raise true patriots of our country. Who from their swaddling clothes will have memorized the military charter and the 10 commandments of Putinism. We will protect them from the pernicious influence of liberal parents. This will be the stronghold of our future prosperity and triumph.
Second. Engage the geneticists. The country does not need idle housewives and thinkers of any kind. The genes of future generations must be the right ones: patriotic, male, warlike.
Is it really so difficult? Get to work.

We will revive our great country and our great "second army of the world." Moreover, we will make it the first! Whatever the price.  Over the corpses of our enemies, through the tears of mothers, across the ravaged land — we will advance without fear and without mercy. We will crush any resistance and completely destroy anyone who dares to rise up against us. Even if it means bringing the entire country to its knees, we will do it. Make no mistake: the will of the state is iron, and nothing and no one can stop it.

(Stormy, prolonged applause.)

## 4. NOBEL CAPERS

![](Images/En_Album_001.jpg)

American bar.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump at table, drinking beer.

**Trump**:

— Vova, after you took care of Navalny, your political scene is a total cakewalk. Smooth sailing. God's in his heaven, all's right with the world.

**Putin**:

— Don't be naive. Navalny was a nobody. All talk, no action. A glorified blogger.

**Trump**:

— Then why'd you have to wipe his whole organization off the map? For a nobody?

**Putin**:

— Donny, use your head. The man had no platform. Just a bunch of kids in the streets chanting curses at me. Is that a policy? Look at Lenin — now *that* was an agenda: factories for the workers, land for the peasants. This clown? Just insults. It's... tasteless.

**Trump**:

— Yeah, stupid. A real amateur.

**Putin**:

— Precisely. In my entire career, only one man ever truly worried me — Boris Nemtsov. A real politician. Knew what he was doing.

**Trump**:

— So you had him whacked so he wouldn't run?

**Putin** (scoffs):

—  No. We wouldn't have let him run anyway — the election commission would've seen to that. And for the record, I didn't give that order.

**Trump**:

— But come on, Vova. Everyone knows it was your security guys.

**Putin**:

— We don't do messy public spectacles anymore. That's last century's playbook. Why the drama and the headlines when you can make anyone... disappear? Quietly. Neatly. Anyone. Even a U.S. President.

**Trump** (shifting uncomfortably):

— Whoa, Vova, that's not my war! That's all on Biden. And you know I'm your friend. You know that.

**Putin** (in a mocking tone):

— I know. I see you twisting in the wind, playing both sides.

**Trump** (defensively):

— Vova, I swear on my life, I got nothing against you personally. Hell, I even get where you're coming from. I just... I want that Nobel!

**Putin** (musing aloud):

— A perfectly understandable ambition. I've been thinking... why shouldn't I have one? Next year, perhaps.

**Trump** (eyes popping):

— You?!

**Putin** (condescendingly):

—  Donny, everyone has a price. Some are just cheaper than others. And if that doesn't work... well, there are other levers. Threats, kompromat, blackmail... The machine is very, very efficient.

(A heavy pause hangs in the air)

**Putin** (with an ironic smile):

— You know, a Nobel would look even better on my chest than on yours. Just think of the headline: "War Criminal Putin, Nobel Laureate." That is the ultimate  proof of my power over the world. It's even cooler than my army at the gates of Paris! That's how you bend this cowardly Europe over and fuck it good and proper!

**Trump** (nervously):

— Hey, Vova, how about... I get the Nobel first, then you can do whatever you want with this cowardly Europe. Deal?

**Putin** (waves a dismissive hand):

— Fine. You first, Donny. Besides, I've got to get to Kyiv before I start collecting prizes...

## 5. SHITTY IMMORTALITY

![](Images/En_Album_57.jpg)

Russia, Kremlin, President’s office. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mikhail Kovalchuk, his old friend, now overseeing life-extension research, at table.

**Putin** (almost affectionately):

– Well, Professor, report: how are things progressing with my immortality?

**Kovalchuk** (enthusiastically):

– There’s progress. Significant. We’re currently working on a project to preserve your... biological materials.

**Putin** (surprised):

– What? What does poop have to do with that?

**Kovalchuk** (hurriedly):

– Hold on. Don’t fuss. Hear me out first.

**Putin** (graciously):

– Speak.

**Kovalchuk**:

– Science has proven that freeze-drying excrement preserves intact DNA. We’ll freeze-dry and preserve your shit and pair it with a stack of photographs and a collection of your speeches. In the distant future, using your DNA and relying on your photos and samples of your public appearances, an exact replica of Vladimir Putin will be recreated. Probably 3D-printed. Well? What do you say?

**Putin** (pensively):

— Shitty immortality. A shitty idea. Say you print me out. But who am I? Nobody. Someone else will be sitting on the throne. They will immediately bring charges against me: the war, the arsons, the bombings, the cables, everything.

**Kovalchuk**:

— I don’t know about that. It’s impossible to predict what political system Russia will have by then.

**Putin** (with emphasis):

— That’s the point. I want a different kind of immortality. I want this — my present body — to serve me forever. Is that so hard?! Heart worn out — transplant. Liver, kidneys — transplant... It's as simple as that!

**Kovalchuk** (cautiously):

– But every organ has a service life – no more than eighty years...

**Putin**:

– Then take a heart from a schoolkid – a recent graduate. What, you feel sorry for some kid for my sake?

**Kovalchuk** (fervently):

– Not at all! I’d give you my own heart...

**Putin** (disgustedly):

– I don’t want yours. What the hell do I need your rusty junk for? Get me a young heart, with plenty of life left. And in 60 years, put in a new one. What’s so complicated?

**Kovalchuk**:

– At present, medicine can’t guarantee the organ will take. The probability of complications is quite high. So either wait another 20 years, or we preserve the shit.

**Putin** (grumpily):

– Fine, have it your way. Go on with your shit. But only as a backup. In the worst case, after my… death [his face distorted, as if in severe pain] it’ll go under the hammer for a million.

**Kovalchuk** (smiling):

– Yes. In the West, the shit of the powerful is highly valued. Some Italian artist, I think his name was Mandzoni, sold his poop for the price of gold. And now a 30-gram can of this shit costs hundreds of thousands of euros.

**Putin** (contemptuously):

– Well, if some lousy Italian shat gold ingots – my shit will go for ten million!

**Kovalchuk** (flatteringly):

– Maybe even more!

**Putin**:

– Only one condition: no greed! 30 grams?! That’s a laughingstock! What am I, a pigeon?

**Kovalchuk** (convincingly):

– You? No. You are a falcon. An eagle. A kite. A pterodactyl.

**Putin** (arrogantly):

– Exactly. And my shit must be of the highest quality. Refined. Deodorized. And make it blue. Blue blood – blue shit.

**Kovalchuk**:

– Of course, of course. First press. Virgin Putin shit. Or Putin virgin shit? Which is correct?

**Putin** (with hatred):

– Dismissed!

## 6. CULTURAL INFILTRATION OPERATION 

![](Images/Fr_Album_60.jpg)

Russia. Moscow. State Duma hall.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin is speaking to the deputies.

**Putin:**

— Esteemed deputies! Friends! Comrades!
The geopolitical situation has reached a boiling point. Russia’s enemies are not sitting idle. The West is doing everything in its power to destroy us. Especially Europe. Especially France. France has always been and remains our main adversary. France has constantly encroached on our traditional values, trying to destroy our cultural heritage and our language. Let us recall the 19th century, when, as a result of a French influence operation, the entire Russian elite spoke exclusively in French for decades. The Russian language found itself on the verge of complete oblivion and extinction. And if it weren’t for the deep Russian people, who quite rightly hated everything French, we would all now be speaking in French!

Yes, in the 19th century French intelligence failed, but now they are trying to take revenge.
Our enemies accuse us of allegedly waging a hybrid war against the West. Brazen lies! We are peaceful people. But the French truly do attack our culture, our traditional values, our language again and again. They have infiltrated the Russian language with a massive enemy landing force. Just look at how many French words we have — words so cleverly disguised that people don’t even suspect their speech is packed with French spy-words.

Chauffeur, tableau, theatre, chef-d’œuvre… There are thousands of them. It’s no longer clear whether it’s still Russian or already a dialect of French.
Well, the word “chauffeur” is nothing. But they're sneaking such destructive words as "president" and "revolution" into our language! This is nothing but blatant sabotage and an assault on our traditional values. What is this “president”? Russia has never had and never will have “presidents.” Only a tsar [pounds his chest]. Or take “revolution.” Revolutions and guillotines for royal families are purely French socio-political phenomena, absolutely alien to the Russian spirit. And by the way, we never had these abominations — until these shameful sabotage-words entered our language.

And this makes sense, comrades. Remember the Bible: “In the beginning was the Word.” And only after that — everything else. Meaning: there can be no revolution until the word “revolution” exists in the language. For example. In the Soviet Union there was no sex — this is a well-known fact. Why? Because there was no word “sex.” But once the opportunist Mikhail Gorbachev opened the borders to Western mass culture, the words “sex,” “gay,” “lesbian,” “LGBT” entered — and after that, debauchery and sodomy blossomed in Russia.

The conclusion, comrades: if we want to eradicate a phenomenon alien to our culture, we must erase from the language the very word that denotes it. Ban it by law, rewrite dictionaries, burn all books containing that word. All violators must be prosecuted.

And our so-called “linguists,” who shyly call these spy-words “borrowings”? This is sabotage, comrades, and we must stop it. First these sabotage-words assimilate, then they begin to multiply, and eventually they drive out the original Russian words. This is linguistic aggression, comrades. Linguistic genocide.
Justifying French borrowings in the Russian language must legally be equated to justifying terrorism. From five years to life imprisonment, depending on the particular word.

For neutral words (chauffeur, revanche, chef-d’œuvre, theatre) — five years.
For “revolution” (undermining the constitutional order) — ten years.
For “president” (discrediting the national leader) — fifteen years.

But the most insidious French sabotage-word is “condom.” We have seen with our own eyes how, after linguistic expansion, our market was literally flooded with these devilish rubber products. French ones, by the way. This unprecedented attack is aimed at the most valuable thing we have — our gene pool. This is a demographic atomic bomb, comrades. To destroy Russians even before they are born. This is the most blasphemous, the most sophisticated weapon of mass destruction.

The word “condom” must be erased from the Russian language. We must uproot it from our lives. The use of this word in any form is an act of high treason. In its highest manifestation. The depiction of a condom must be equated with displaying extremist symbols.

And in the future.
Comrades! We must strictly protect our language from the penetration of Western sabotage-words. This is the main defensive line in our struggle for traditional values.

Thank you for your attention!

## 7. PUTIN’S HANDBOOK: "1984" REVISITED

![](Images/All_Album_64.jpg)

Russia, Moscow, the Kremlin. Meeting of the heads of state security and law enforcement agencies. President of Russia Vladimir Putin speaking.

**Putin**: 

— Comrades! Who among you has read the seminal work of the great British writer **George Orwell**, "**1984**"? No one? You should. It is our handbook.

Dear comrade Orwell described a fairly effective totalitarian system of government. Of course, in the middle of the last century, he couldn't have even dreamed of the technologies we have at our disposal today. Because of this, his system is quite cumbersome, resource-heavy, and expensive. But regardless — it works perfectly! Even in conditions of technological backwardness.

But the main thing, comrades, is his immortal totalitarian ideas: ***doublethink***, the ***mutability of the past***, and the ***thought police***.

We have already adopted some things from his system and are applying them with great success. But, as they say, there is still room for improvement.

First and foremost, we must introduce the concept of ***thoughtcrime*** into our jurisprudence. This concept follows logically from our traditional values. Remember what Christ said in his sermons: if you have lusted after your brother’s wife, you have already committed adultery. Thus, according to the dogmas of our Orthodox Christian Church, the very thought of sin becomes a sin. This is an important metaphysical leap that we are simply duty-bound to put at the service of our state security.

So, we didn't invent ***thoughtcrime***, and neither did Orwell — it was invented by Lord God Himself.

What does this mean for us in practice?
First: a special unit must appear within the police — Thought Purity Department. Put simply, that very Orwellian ***Thought Police***.

Second: we must refine our criminal and administrative codes by introducing punishments for ***thoughtcrime***.
And most importantly — we must launch practical work among the population.

Let’s turn back to our handbook. In the mythical country of Oceania, dissenters were identified by establishing 24-hour surveillance over citizens using so-called ***telescreens***. Unlike Oceania, which, as I understand, had the status of a pariah on the international stage, Russia is one of the major geopolitical players and must maintain at least some semblance of basic decency. Therefore, we cannot openly violate such fundamental civil rights as the right to privacy.

Furthermore, ***telescreens*** are effective tools of intimidation, but uncovering secret thoughts requires clandestine methods. No one will confess to heresy if they know they are being monitored.

We have already taken a large — a huge — step in this direction: we developed and implemented the mandatory messenger MAX, which allows us to covertly monitor our citizens' communications. 

But! When a foreign agent goes to a protest, stands in a solo picket, or publishes unpatriotic appeals on the internet — that is already an advanced stage of ideological deviation. That can no longer be cured; it can only be punished with imprisonment.

In fact, you know, I suggest viewing dissent as a progressive disease. If we manage to diagnose it at an early stage, there is a very good chance that, with the help of basic corrective procedures, we can cure a person of this illness forever.

Therefore — our attention must be directed primarily at children. Yes, our "Talks about the Important things" are already standard practice across the country. This is wonderful — we are instilling the correct mindsets in our children. But we need feedback! What do we have in this regard? Student surveys? They are absolutely ineffective; it’s like expecting a foreign agent to confess in front of a ***telescreen***.

We need a systemic, global solution. And it lies right on the surface. What will we do? We will install 24-hour audio surveillance in kindergartens, schools, and other educational institutions. Not video surveillance — no. That is expensive and unnecessary. We don’t need faces — only conversations and a voice recognition system. This is simpler and cheaper. And it can be done covertly.

Next, artificial intelligence analyzes the information coming to the server and produces the final result: "Petya Belkin from 3rd grade at School No. 212 is unreliable; yesterday during the break between the second and third lessons, he used an insulting remark directed at the President."

Petya is then handled by the juvenile department for painless ideological correction — much like the way a child’s teeth are straightened with braces when they grow sideways.
And exactly like crooked teeth — in childhood, such ideological correction is still possible.

And by the way, when little Petya grows up, he will only be grateful to us for helping him get rid of wrong thoughts in his childhood and thereby saving him from prison.

Naturally, total audio surveillance should be carried out in all state institutions — we are not breaking any laws there. In coordination with private business owners, we will also install monitoring devices on their premises and in their offices. If they refuse to cooperate — well, you know how to persuade them.

Our ultimate goal, comrades, is to build a harmonious society — a society based on the principles of homogeneity, conformity, solidarity, and cohesion.

So that I no longer have to lie during a "Direct Line" with the people, claiming that foreign agents in Russia are not subject to criminal prosecution.

We won’t actually have to persecute dissenters — for the simple reason that we won’t have any dissenters left.

## 8. PUTIN IN THE HALL OF TWO TRUTHS: JUDGMENT OF OSIRIS

![](Images/En_Album_003.jpg)

> Sacred ancient Egyptian temple. Inside, well-known procedure of Judgment of the Egyptian god Osiris, as described in the "Book of the Dead," is taking place. Also participate:
> 
> • God Thoth (court secretary, clay tablet in  hands)
>
> • God Anubis (forensic expert)
>
> • Goddess Maat (prosecutor)
>
> • 42 Egyptian God-jurors (wearing masks of Hitler, Mussolini, Lenin, Stalin, Beria, Brezhnev, Zhirinovsky, Dracula, the Devil, and other historical figures)
>
> • Russian president, Vladimir Putin (defendant)
>
> Hall illuminated by TV screens broadcasting court proceedings. Putin stands by gigantic apothecary scales; on one scale pan lies a red paper heart with a gilded engraving: "Putin: 86%". The other pan is empty, yet the scales balance each other.

**Osiris**:

— We begin the live broadcast of the most fair trial in the history of the universe! Today, on the Scales of Truth — the fate of the Great Guardian of Traditional Values! But first — a word from our sponsor. Presenting: the elixir of youth "Ambre"!

(Commercial break: the goddess Hathor drinks the potion and instantly becomes 3000 years younger. Voiceover: "Ambre: a sip leading to Eternity.")

**Osiris** (addressing Putin):

— Do you trust this court? Any objections to the judges?

**Putin** (with a slight smile):

— Oh, Your Honor! How could I! The history of Russian-Egyptian relations... We have repeatedly provided aid... Forgiven debts... Built power plants... The Aswan Dam... Complete mutual understanding...

**Osiris**:

— Of course. We remember. The court will now retire to the deliberation room.

(Everyone remains seated, as they were.)

**Maat**:

— I object! You are violating procedure! The defendant has not yet recited the 42 declarations of innocence before the jurors: I have not killed, not stolen, not lied, not falsified weights and measures... and so on.

**Osiris** (reluctantly):

— Hmm... Very well. Defendant, tell us your autobiography.

**Putin**:

— Gladly, Your Honor.
I was born an ordinary Petersburg kid — an average C student. And through my own persistent labor, reaping the rewards in the field of state service, I climbed to the pinnacle of power — became president of a great country. I pursued the most humane and just policies. In my decrees, I promised every citizen a separate apartment, free healthcare and education, high wages, and zero inflation. I established lasting peace in the warlike Chechen Republic. I became the world's most generous donor. I built 20 oil and gas pipelines. My gas lights and heats the entire planet. I aid national liberation movements worldwide — supplying them with weapons at discounted prices. I distribute billion-dollar loans to poor countries and annul their debts a couple of years later. I give China my natural resources for a pittance. Thanks to my policies, the NATO bloc has significantly expanded its borders. I liberated the fraternal Ukrainian people from the tyranny of Zelensky's fascist regime. I stopped the bloody slaughter in Ukraine.

(An ad pops up on the screen: "Gas for every tomb! Let life never end!")

**Putin** (looks at the screen for a second, then continues with his statement):

— I launched the first man into space. My court composer wrote the immortal masterpiece "Swan Lake" [performs a few ballet steps to Tchaikovsky's music]. Finally, I rid the world of Hitler and his fascist dictatorship.
I toiled like a slave on a galley in the post of President for 50 years! I served a life sentence!
I lifted my country from its knees. I sold the factories to the workers and the land to the peasants. I created the world's number one army.
I extended a helping hand and protected Russian-speaking compatriots abroad from arbitrary treatment: in the Baltics, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. We safeguard the rights and freedoms of Russian diasporas across the entire former USSR.
Life expectancy in the country increased dramatically: I lived to be 98 years old.
Medicine is developing at a rapid pace: I died not from illness, but from boredom.
The patriotism of the younger generation is off the charts: my portrait hangs in every school classroom. Traditional values are taking root deep. We only have two-sex marriages. Divorces, abortions, condoms —  banned. Lesbians and gays — stripped of citizenship. Opponents and critics of the government — all in prison. On Earth, peace; among men — complete loyalty. Is this not an idyll? I have established an eternal celebration of life in my country.

**Osiris** (smiling broadly):

— Enough. You are the quintessence of virtue. The court will now retire to the deliberation room.

(Everyone remains seated.)

**Maat** (angrily):

— Wait! You are violating procedure again... The prosecution has not yet had its say!

**Osiris**:

— Dear Maat, all in due time. A time to gather stones, a time to listen to fables. When it's time for your fantasies [suddenly shouting], I will tell you! The court will now retire to the deliberation room!

(Everyone remains seated.)

**Osiris** (after a pause):

— Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please vote...

**Maat** (jumping up, brandishing her feathers):

— I object! The prosecution's case has not been heard! The weighing of the heart has not been conducted!

**Osiris** (sternly):

— Dear Maat, the defendant's heart was weighed in a special procedure. It has been found lighter than your feather. For it is as pure as the tear of an unborn infant! Anubis!

**Anubis** (producing a pre-prepared protocol from under his robe):

— The scales show zero point zero grams. Innocence is total and absolute.

(The scale pans suddenly begin to oscillate up and down spontaneously. Anubis grabs the pans, trying to balance them.)

**Osiris** (unperturbed):

— It's nothing: perturbations on the Sun. The mechanism appears to be... weather-dependent.

**Putin** (staring into the emptiness above the gods' heads):

— The machinations of Western partners led by NATO. They've even reached the Afterlife. Again, they are encroaching on our spiritual bonds.

**Osiris** (banging his staff on the floor):

— So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let's vote. Do you confirm the defendant's complete innocence?

**Jurors** (in unison):

— Yes!

**Zhirinovsky**:

— Clone him!

**Brezhnev**:

— Decorate him with an award!

**The Devil**:

— Canonize him!

**Stalin**:

— We are of the same blood!

**Beria**:

— I bow to you, Teacher!

**Mussolini**:

— Pleased to meet you, colleague!

**Dracula**:

— You know how to suck. Our kind of guy!

**Osiris** (ignoring Maat's protests):

— The court announces the verdict:
The defendant is acquitted.

**Maat** (waving a thick stack of photos in the air):

— Are you out of your minds? Here is the evidence! Murders! Abductions! Poisonings! Wars! Hybrid attacks! Falsifications!

(The evidence appears on the screen but almost instantly vanishes. The screen is covered with fine static. A minute later, an image of Putin against the backdrop of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior appears, immediately replaced by the cartoon "Dunno on the Moon".)

**Osiris** (smiling):

— Esteemed gods! Let's vote! All in favor of immortality, glory, and apotheosis for the defendant?

(All 42 gods raise their hands in unison. A commercial is broadcast: "The new 'Pharaoh-Deluxe' sarcophagus! Three colors: black granite, white marble, George ribbon.")

**Thoth** (reading from the clay tablet):

— Approved unanimously! Death is revoked, eternal life is granted! The name "Vladimir Putin" shall be inscribed on the title page of the "Book of the Dead" in golden ink!

**Putin** (nodding):

— I thank you. This is our shared victory. Special thanks to my faithful dog, Anubis. He's a good boy.

(Anubis wags his tail, embarrassed.)

**Maat** (in despair, dropping her feathers on the floor):

— Inconceivable! Unbelievable! I am filing an appeal with the Martian Intergalactic Court!

(She is dragged away under the arms by attendants with bear heads. The broadcast cuts out. The screen shows dancing Cossacks.)

**Thoth** (closing the case folder):

— Thank you all, you are free to go. The session is closed.

> **Culturological Commentary**
>
> The miniature is based on the ancient Egyptian myth of the Judgment of Osiris. According to the "Book of the Dead," the soul of the deceased was brought into the Hall of Two Truths, where it faced:
>
> — Osiris — god of the underworld, presiding judge.
>
> — Maat — goddess of truth and justice, the standard of purity.
>
> — Anubis — jackal-headed god who conducted the weighing of the heart.
>
> — Thoth — god of wisdom, court scribe.
>
> — 42 God-jurors — each responsible for one specific sin; the deceased had to swear before each god that he had not committed that sin.
>
> The main procedure — the weighing of the heart: the heart of the deceased was placed on one scale pan, and the feather of Maat on the other. If the heart was "lighter than the feather," the soul was deemed pure and granted eternal life; if heavier, it faced annihilation. This ritual symbolized absolute justice and the impossibility of deception.

## 9. GEOPOLITICAL SANDBOX
*Unfinished Mini-Play*

![](Images/All_Album_61.jpg)

Seven boys are playing in the Sandbox:
 Bully, Jew, and five others. Each boy is special, each wears a unique headpiece: a red cap, a white cap, a bucket hat, a peaked cap, a hat.
 

**ACT 1**

The Boys in the Sandbox

**HAT**:

— News, everyone! The Bully has started another fight.

**WHITE CAP:**

— With whom this time?

**HAT**:

— The Jew.

**WHITE CAP** (sternly):

— Bully, stop it immediately! Disrupting order in the Sandbox is unacceptable!

**BULLY**:

— And who are you to give me orders?

**WHITE CAP:**

— I am the Sandbox monitor. I am the moral authority.

**BULLY**:

— And I am the criminal Authority. I don’t care about your rules. I have a special path and special moral values.

**PEAKED CAP** (cautiously):

— And what's the fight about anyway? What are you arguing over?

**BULLY:**

— He grabbed my land!

**WHITE CAP:**

— Since when is it yours?

**BULLY**:

— It’s always been mine. My great-grandfather’s ashes are buried there!

**HAT**:

— But we agreed on the inviolability of borders! Your Uncle Boris put his signature on it!

**BULLY**:

— Boris was a fool and an alcoholic. Therefore, the deal is declared null and void! It’s my land. End of discussion.

(The Bully walks up to the Jew and punches him in the chest.)

**JEW**:

— Help! He’s killing me!

**HAT**:

— Hang in there, little guy! We’ll pass a Resolution right now. First. We fully condemn this aggression! And we call on all parties to exercise restraint.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— Second. We recognize the Jew’s legitimate right to defend his territory by any means necessary.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— Third. We call on the Bully to respect the established order and immediately cease the conflict.

**WHITE CAP:**

— Should we maybe actually help him?

**BULLY** (making a scary face):

— Just you try! You’ll get a black eye!

**HAT**:

— Such statements are unacceptable! Personally, I find them concerning.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— And disconcerting.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— Guys, we need to be careful with him. Don’t forget: he has a bulldozer.

**BULLY**:

— Spot on! I’ll bring my bulldozer and smash this whole Sandbox to splinters!

(He hits the Jew again.)

**JEW** (in a whisper):

— He’s killing me.

**HAT**:

— My concern has increased many times over.

**PEAKED CAP**:

— My disconcertment is growing exponentially.

**WHITE CAP:**

— I heard that his so-called bulldozer is all rusted out and won’t start.

**BUCKET HAT** (with doubt in his voice):

— We don’t know for sure, what if he fixed it and installed new spark plugs?

**HAT**:

— We must be prudent. Let’s not anger him.

**BUCKET HAT**:

— But it’s obvious: as soon as he finishes off the Jew, he’ll attack the rest of us!

**PEAKED CAP:**

— I am, of course, a bit farther from him, and across the strait, but still, my knees are trembling with fear. Here’s an idea: let’s help the Jew, but just a little bit and secretly. That way the Bully won’t notice.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— The main thing is not to give too much. If the Bully starts losing ground, he’ll get angry. And then he’ll definitely bring his bulldozer and raze the entire Sandbox to the ground.

**HAT**:

— Correct. Let them fight. While the Bully is busy with this brawl, we can sleep soundly.

**WHITE CAP:**

— Excellent plan. We’ll do just that.


**ACT 2**

The New Monitor

A boy in a red cap, holding a golf club, approaches the Sandbox.

**RED CAP:**

— So, what do we have here? A complete mess. It’s all your fault, you foolish old man. Get out of the Sandbox! Your time is up. I’m the monitor now.

**WHITE CAP:**

— Fine. I’m leaving. I did all I could. Good luck with this conflict!

**RED CAP:**

— That’s not why I came. I came to get the Gold Peacemaker Medal. You, with your stupid decrees, only fueled this fight. I came to stop it. You’re a fool, and I’m smart. That’s the whole difference between us. Get out and stop bothering me.

(White Cap leaves.)

**JEW** (looking at the new monitor with hope):

— You will help me, right?

**RED CAP** (sternly):

— So many fine young men have fallen! Beautiful, splendid young men! And all because of you. Why did you let yourself be dragged into this conflict?

**JEW** (stunned):

— I let myself?! He was the one who started it!

**RED CAP**:

— And didn’t you see he’s a thousand times stronger than you? A normal person doesn’t pick a fight with a superior opponent. You should have negotiated right away, not escalated the conflict.

**JEW**:

— But I couldn’t just give him the land! My constitution doesn’t allow it.

**RED CAP**:

— Don’t give me that! You have no cards. You didn’t give it up then, you’ll give it up now. Don’t give it up now, you’ll give it up in a year. Same difference. Only another half a million fine boys will end up in the grave.

**JEW**:

— But that’s not fair! You should help me defeat him instead.

**RED CAP** (with condemnation):

— How much help did the old man give you? Billions in coins. You didn’t even say thank you. You just kept whining and begging for more. And then — where is it all? What happened to those billions?

**JEW**:

— I’m ashamed to admit it, but... they were a bit embezzled. It just happened. It’s not my fault!!!

**RED CAP:**

— You have to pay back all those billions to me. I heard significant deposits of rare-earth metals have been found on your plot? They belong to me now.

**JEW** (agitated):

— This is robbery!

**RED CAP**:

— You thought you’d get a free ride? That’s not how things are done. Sign here.

**JEW**:

— But I’m not authorized. I need parliamentary approval...

**RED CAP**:

— Oh, really?! Hey, Steve, call the guys — tell them to hold back our intel.

**JEW** (desperately):

— Not the intel! I beg you!

**RED CAP:**

— So, are you signing or not?

**JEW** (dejectedly):

— I’m signing.


**ACT 3**

The Same Characters

**RED CAP:**

— So, we begin the peace process. I demand an end to this fight. Bully, state your terms.

**BULLY**:

— He must give me two regions. Throw half of his toy soldiers in the trash. And renounce joining any military blocs.

**RED CAP:**

— Hmm... Not bad. Jew, do you agree?

**JEW** (firmly):

— Over my dead body.

**BULLY** (with a gloating smirk):

— That can be arranged.

**RED CAP:**

— Enough with your jokes! Jew, what’s the problem?

**JEW**:

— He wants me to give him the land without a fight. That’s absurd! There’s no precedent for that in military history.

**RED CAP:**

— Why do you need so much land? Half your population has emigrated.

**JEW**:

— I can’t. Society is against voluntary cession of territory.

**RED CAP:**

— Hey, Steve! Hold back our intel!

**JEW** (hurriedly):

— Alright, alright. I agree, but I demand thorough detailing of the specifics.

**RED CAP:**

— What about the toy soldiers? And renouncing military blocs?

**JEW**:

— In that case, I need ironclad security guarantees — in case the Bully tries to take more of my land. Who will protect me? And how?

**RED CAP:**

— I’m giving you a personal guarantee: in case of renewed aggression, we’ll... figure something out. A 100% guarantee.


**ACT 4**

The Same Characters

**RED CAP:**

— I’m doing everything possible to reconcile these brawlers. I’ve tried every means. But the peace process is somehow stalled.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— You’re the best negotiator — strict but fair. Can I call you “Daddy”?

**HAT**:

— The perfect nickname! Daddy! We are in awe of your diplomatic skill! However, one can’t help but notice that you’re putting pressure on the Jew while fully supporting the Bully’s demands.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— Daddy! We would recommend putting pressure on the Bully as well — for example, you could give the Jew weapons. You promised! But for some reason, you aren’t...

**HAT**:

— It seems Daddy is afraid of the Bully’s bulldozer.

**RED CAP:**

— The bulldozer is a bluff. The Bully is pulling our leg. I’m not afraid of the bulldozer. What I am truly afraid of is that he’ll sneak up from behind, splash gasoline on my trousers, and set them on fire.

(Hat, Peaked Cap, and Bucket Hat exchange meaningful glances and giggle nervously.)

**RED CAP:**

— What’s so funny? Your pants are just as vulnerable to him as mine are! So I advise you to think long and hard before giving weapons to the Jew. Personally, I wash my hands of it.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— Well, then you could impose secondary sanctions on the Bully.

**RED CAP:**

— Sanctions are a debatable matter. First, I don’t want to scare him away from the negotiations. Right now, the Bully is meeting me halfway, and we should value that. Second, he has the world’s largest reserves of rare-earth metals. Why should I quarrel with him if I intend, after peace is concluded, to trade and jointly develop those unique deposits? And besides: my personal friendly relationship with the Bully is the key to future peace in the Sandbox.

(Pause.)

**RED CAP:**

— As for you three — I have major grievances with you! Do you think I’ll come to your rescue when the Bully attacks you? Don’t even hope. Enough of freeloading off me! You’re big boys and must learn to defend yourselves. You need to increase your defense spending to 5 percent of your GDP. That’s an order!
And stop this idiotic immigration! Just look at yourselves in the mirror, see what you’ve become. Where has all your aristocratic bearing, your moral values, your faith gone? You’re destroying your own identity with your own hands. If things continue like this — our friendship will be over!


**ACT 5**

The Same Characters

**RED CAP:**

— So, to summarize. The thirteenth round of talks was sabotaged by the Jew — forcing me to kick him out of the Oval Office. The fourteenth round was sabotaged by the Bully, because, apparently, his plane number one got lost in a labyrinth of clouds.

**BULLY** (casually):

— That’s exactly what happened — the Jew disabled all my navigation systems!

**RED CAP:**

— Fine, whatever! Let’s schedule a date for the next round. And no more nonsense! I propose next Thursday.

**JEW**:

— Won’t work for me — I have Shabbat.

**RED CAP:**

— Then Friday.

**BULLY:**

— Christ was crucified on a Friday.

**RED CAP:**

— Then Saturday, Sunday, Monday...

**BULLY** (shaking his head negatively):

— A three-day mourning period has been declared nationwide...

**RED CAP** (furious):

— Then today! Now! This minute!
I demand that you make peace! Sit down at the negotiating table!

(Red Cap pulls out a folding table and two chairs from behind his back.)

**RED CAP:**

— My pleasure! Have a seat!

**BULLY**:

— Well, now! My chair has gone missing. This is direct sabotage of the negotiation process. I can’t negotiate standing up!

**JEW**:

— And a leg broke off my chair! It’s all the Bully, his tricks!

(Waves a chair leg in the air.)

**RED CAP** (wearily, with a martyred expression):

— The fifteenth round of negotiations is concluded. The dialogue was productive but difficult. We eagerly await the next meeting. There’s a good chance of reaching an agreement before Thanksgiving.

## 12. BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS...

![](Images/All_Album_65.jpg)

American bar. Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump at table, drinking beer.

**Trump**:

— This whole Ukraine mess is a total pain in my ass. Honestly, I almost wish I’d never gotten involved in your little spat. My time’s running out, and if I don’t snag a Nobel Peace Prize by then? They’ll call me the biggest loser, the most hated president ever. Total disaster.

(Pause)

**Trump (pleading):**

— Come on, Vova, why won't you help me out? I put every single point you asked for in the deal. Buddy, let's just sign this peace treaty already! It's a hell of a deal for you. And the best part? It gets me the glory I deserve.

**Putin (indifferently):**

— Donnie, I've got my own image to worry about. I need the Donbas, don't you get it? I've already enshrined it in the Constitution as legitimate Russian territory. And let's not forget: I've spilled a river of blood for that goddamn Donbas. I need to hand it to my voters on a silver platter. No Donbas, no victory. And that means every single sacrifice in this bloody war was for nothing.

**Trump (lowering his voice):**

— Listen, Vova, nothing's stopping you from picking this up again in a couple of years — just wait until I'm out, okay? Stage a Ukrainian attack on your residence. Out in Tver, in the nature reserve. But make it look good. If you’re gonna cry wolf, show a real wolf. The *Reichstag’s* gotta burn for real. Launch the drones from their side. Burn your favorite palace to the ground, take out a hundred hectares of ancient forest while you're at it. Show the cameras some dead endangered animals. Give people a story they can believe. A top-shelf casus belli.

**Putin (doubtfully):**

— But you're giving Ukraine security guarantees. If some nosy journalist digs it up and finds out it's a total setup, NATO could invoke Article 5 against me.

(Pause.)

**Putin (firmly):**

— I need ironclad guarantees, Donnie. Guarantees of impunity.

**Trump (nodding in agreement):**

— Of course. And you've got 'em, Vova. The best guarantees aren't the ones signed on paper; the best ones are a gentleman's handshake.
Just think back, Vova. After the USSR fell apart, Ukraine got "ironclad guarantees," right? And what happened? Did anyone lift a finger when you moved in? Hell no. So why would new "guarantees" be any different? Me? I won't get involved in your scrap with Ukraine no matter what. Especially if you put on a convincing enough show. Look at Obama, look at Biden — they were scared shitless of an open fight with Russia. America doesn’t go to war unless our interests are at stake.

**Putin (skeptically):**

— And Europe?

**Trump (contemptuously):**

— Europe? Give me a break. They’re not jumping into the fire. Not after you showed them your playbook: just throw more bodies at the problem. Mountains of corpses. The very sight of it makes Europe shake in its boots. Over there, they’re obsessed with human life. As for sending weapons, they'll keep feeding them to Ukraine just long enough to rebuild their own defenses. Did you think they're doing it out of the goodness of their hearts? Yeah, right. They're doing it so Ukraine takes the bullet for them. Guards Europe's border with its own blood.

So you've got zero reason to worry. Let's freeze the conflict along the current front line. For now. You take a breather and modernize your hardware. Your own economy's on its last legs! And in a couple of years, you come back with fresh troops.

**Putin:**

— And what do I tell my people?

**Trump:**

— What’s to tell? Mission accomplished. Denazification, demilitarization — done. The Donbas is "practically fully" liberated. Don't sweat the numbers. "Practically fully" sounds like a triumph. The rights of Russian speakers? Protected. What defeat? What are you talking about? It's a clear victory. Phase one. Then, after I get my Nobel and my term's over, you can finish the job and claim your total, final victory.
Come on, Vova! Don't be a stubborn prick! Let's sign the damn deal and be done with it!

### Bonus Track: Evidentiary Miniature

**This thirteenth play stands outside the numbering. Here, literature borders on the protocol: every word is confirmed by the real experience of survival. Satire is merely the setting. The essence is the testimony**.
                            
## FSB PLAYBOOK: LESSON ONE

Russia, Moscow. A cozy apartment in a high-rise building. Relaxing comfortably in armchairs, two Russian intelligence officers discuss the details of an upcoming operation.

**SENKO** (cheerfully): 

— Well, that’s it, brother. The old lady is done for. We’ve finally backed her into a corner.

**VECHIRKO** (doubtfully): 

— We’ve backed her into a corner a hundred times — so what? She’s alive and well, still riding that damn bicycle of hers. An old hag on wheels.

**SENKO** (with a poisonous smirk): 

— The bicycle is exactly what’s going to put her in the grave.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Brakes again? Our guys in Georgia messed with her brakes a hundred times — she just fixes them.

**SENKO**: 

— No, you don’t get it. In Georgia, she didn't have steep descents like she does now. In Georgia, she could stop — here, she can't. As soon as she leaves her campsite and hits the highway, a hellishly steep descent begins. Without brakes, she’ll be carried down like an avalanche. A mile-long drop. The main thing is to get her to sit down and ride.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— And how the hell are you going to make her "sit down and ride"? Maybe she’ll fix them again!

**SENKO**: 

— The trick is that after the grocery store, she doesn't ride the bike; she walks it. Apparently, it’s too heavy for her to haul forty kilograms.

**VECHIRKO** (contemptuously): 

— Some cyclist! If you can't ride uphill, stay home.  Watch TV.

**SENKO**: 

— So, we sabotaged the brakes while she was in the store. She doesn’t know. She won’t notice until three days from now, when she gets on that   bike to head back down to the city.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Broken brakes aren't enough. There’s only one turn on that highway where you can jump out and stage an accident.

**SENKO**: 

— Listen closely, rookie. And learn. We’ve already set the stage. We’re faking road repairs. Look at this.

(Senko brings up several photos on the computer screen.)

**SENKO**: 

— We put two signs across the road: "To City Center — Detour." There’s a road branching off to the right here, but the turn is nearly 120 degrees.

![](Images/All_Album_66_1.jpg)

**SENKO**: 

— If she tries to make that turn at speed, she’ll miss it and fly off the cliff. A hundred-meter drop. Death guaranteed. But most likely, she’ll try to push through, down the highway. That’s where the big surprise awaits. Look.

(Senko brings up the next photo.)

![](Images/All_Album_66_2.jpg)

**SENKO**: 

— Ten meters further, a massive piece of construction machinery is blocking her path. She’ll try to bypass it on the left, of course. But a few meters later, on the left side, there's an excavator and a large truck that she won't see behind the first machine. Plus, another heavy vehicle will be coming toward her through the remaining narrow corridor.

![](Images/All_Albun_66_3.jpg)

**SENKO**: 

— It’s a death trap, kid. Avoiding a collision in that setup is simply impossible. And don’t forget: her brakes have "failed",  and she’s barreling down at forty kilometers per hour. She won’t even have time to process what’s happening before she’s turned into a pancake. Her and her bike.

**VECHIRKO** (with relief): 

— Well, God willing. God willing. High time she was in the ground. I mean, look: everyone else is normal — they die submissively, without a sound. But this one, for some reason, kicks, defends herself, tries to survive. How many times does the world need to be told: if the secret services decide to kill you, you’ll be killed. Don’t resist, it’s pointless — you’re only prolonging the agony.

**SENKO** (rubbing his hands): 

— Yeah, bro, we’ll finally get our million. We’ve been struggling with this bitch for ten years; I think we’re already working at a loss.
