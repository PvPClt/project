### INTRODUCTION
What lies before you is not just a collection of caricatures. It is an anatomical cross-section of the Putin era: Orthodox military Putinism as a form of collective madness.
Here you will find icons with pagan gods, baptisms in trenches, holy water — administered intramuscularly. Here patriotism comes with a sock on the genitals, and the Pentagon’s combat dolphins swim freely.
In these miniatures, society appears as one where war has replaced common sense, “traditional values” have replaced conscience, and Orthodoxy has become the “lubricant” for missile launchers. Priests bless violence, deputies trade in patriotism, and schools teach not to think, but to give birth and obey.  

Enjoy your reading!

## ZERO-1. NOBEL CAPERS

American bar.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump at table, drinking beer.

**Trump**:

— Vova, after you took care of Navalny, your political scene is a total cakewalk. Smooth sailing. God's in his heaven, all's right with the world.

**Putin**:

— Don't be naive. Navalny was a nobody. All talk, no action. A glorified blogger.

**Trump**:

— Then why'd you have to wipe his whole organization off the map? For a nobody?

**Putin**:

— Donny, use your head. The man had no platform. Just a bunch of kids in the streets chanting curses at me. Is that a policy? Look at Lenin — now *that* was an agenda: factories for the workers, land for the peasants. This clown? Just insults. It's... tasteless.

**Trump**:

— Yeah, stupid. A real amateur.

**Putin**:

— Precisely. In my entire career, only one man ever truly worried me — Boris Nemtsov. A real politician. Knew what he was doing.

**Trump**:

— So you had him whacked so he wouldn't run?

**Putin** (scoffs):

—  No. We wouldn't have let him run anyway — the election commission would've seen to that. And for the record, I didn't give that order.

**Trump**:

— But come on, Vova. Everyone knows it was your security guys.

**Putin**:

— We don't do messy public spectacles anymore. That's last century's playbook. Why the drama and the headlines when you can make anyone... disappear? Quietly. Neatly. Anyone. Even a U.S. President.

**Trump** (shifting uncomfortably):

— Whoa, Vova, that's not my war! That's all on Biden. And you know I'm your friend. You know that.

**Putin** (in a mocking tone):

— I know. I see you twisting in the wind, playing both sides.

**Trump** (defensively):

— Vova, I swear on my life, I got nothing against you personally. Hell, I even get where you're coming from. I just... I want that Nobel!

**Putin** (musing aloud):

— A perfectly understandable ambition. I've been thinking... why shouldn't I have one? Next year, perhaps.

**Trump** (eyes popping):

— You?!

**Putin** (condescendingly):

—  Donny, everyone has a price. Some are just cheaper than others. And if that doesn't work... well, there are other levers. Threats, kompromat, blackmail... The machine is very, very efficient.

(A heavy pause hangs in the air)

**Putin** (with an ironic smile):

— You know, a Nobel would look even better on my chest than on yours. Just think of the headline: "War Criminal Putin, Nobel Laureate." That is the ultimate  proof of my power over the world. It's even cooler than my army at the gates of Paris! That's how you bend this cowardly Europe over and fuck it good and proper!

**Trump** (nervously):

— Hey, Vova, how about... I get the Nobel first, then you can do whatever you want with this cowardly Europe. Deal?

**Putin** (waves a dismissive hand):

— Fine. You first, Donny. Besides, I've got to get to Kyiv before I start collecting prizes...

## ZERO-2. DOCTOR AIBOLIT. VERSION 2.0

![](Images/En_Album_002.jpg)

Beneath a tree, so firm and fit,

Sits kindly Doctor Aibolit.

To clerk and cadet, he calls, "Come near,

I'll mend your wounds and banish fear,"

Says kindly Doctor Aibolit.


Then Musa comes, a limping sight,

"A wasp has stung me in a fight!"

Then Portos groans, "I'll tell you what,

A drone has blown my nose right off!"


A girl runs up, her cries are wild,

"My Vasya, oh my precious child!

He trod a path of mine-laid death,

And blew his legs from underneath!

My poor, lame son, in throbbing pain,

He writhes and whimpers once again!"


But Aibolit says, "Have no dread,

Just bring your boy up to my bed!

I'll stitch new legs, strong and complete,

For marching down that mined-up street!"


So in they carried Vasya, pale,

A broken form, a tragic tale.

The doctor sewed with skill and art,

New limbs to play a deadly part.

His girl now dances, spins with glee,

And shouts, "A miracle to see!

Thank you, good Doctor, for your care!"


But hark!—hoofbeats fill the air,

From the east, a rider, Aksakal.

"An urgent note!" he gives the call.

"I cannot stay, I must be quick!"

And then he leaves with cunning trick.


"It calls you forth to Zhmerynka, go!

Our brothers die, their time runs low!"

"Are they wounded?" asks the saint.

"Yes, and covered in filth and taint."

"They burn with fever, drown in tears,

Their bowels clogged with hopeless fears.

If you won't come to make them whole,

We'll dump them in a swampy hole!


For Putin gave his firm command:

On to the Caucasus, make your stand!"

The sun, the sea, the peaks so grand,

"Russian World" needs a saving hand!


That "Russian World", now vast and eternal—

Mud, swamps, and sands in a cycle infernal,

Where the green men's bootprints, deep and profound,

Are stomped into that consecrated ground.

## ZERO-3. PUTIN IN THE HALL OF TWO TRUTHS: JUDGMENT OF OSIRIS

![](Images/En_Album_003.jpg)

> Sacred ancient Egyptian temple. Inside, well-known procedure of Judgment of the Egyptian god Osiris, as described in the "Book of the Dead," is taking place. Also participate:
> 
> • God Thoth (court secretary, clay tablet in  hands)
>
> • God Anubis (forensic expert)
>
> • Goddess Maat (prosecutor)
>
> • 42 Egyptian God-jurors (wearing masks of Hitler, Mussolini, Lenin, Stalin, Beria, Brezhnev, Zhirinovsky, Dracula, the Devil, and other historical figures)
>
> • Russian president, Vladimir Putin (defendant)
>
> Hall illuminated by TV screens broadcasting court proceedings. Putin stands by gigantic apothecary scales; on one scale pan lies a red paper heart with a gilded engraving: "Putin: 86%". The other pan is empty, yet the scales balance each other.

**Osiris**:

— We begin the live broadcast of the most fair trial in the history of the universe! Today, on the Scales of Truth — the fate of the Great Guardian of Traditional Values! But first — a word from our sponsor. Presenting: the elixir of youth "Ambre"!

(Commercial break: the goddess Hathor drinks the potion and instantly becomes 3000 years younger. Voiceover: "Ambre: a sip leading to Eternity.")

**Osiris** (addressing Putin):

— Do you trust this court? Any objections to the judges?

**Putin** (with a slight smile):

— Oh, Your Honor! How could I! The history of Russian-Egyptian relations... We have repeatedly provided aid... Forgiven debts... Built power plants... The Aswan Dam... Complete mutual understanding...

**Osiris**:

— Of course. We remember. The court will now retire to the deliberation room.

(Everyone remains seated, as they were.)

**Maat**:

— I object! You are violating procedure! The defendant has not yet recited the 42 declarations of innocence before the jurors: I have not killed, not stolen, not lied, not falsified weights and measures... and so on.

**Osiris** (reluctantly):

— Hmm... Very well. Defendant, tell us your autobiography.

**Putin**:

— Gladly, Your Honor.
I was born an ordinary Petersburg kid — an average C student. And through my own persistent labor, reaping the rewards in the field of state service, I climbed to the pinnacle of power — became president of a great country. I pursued the most humane and just policies. In my decrees, I promised every citizen a separate apartment, free healthcare and education, high wages, and zero inflation. I established lasting peace in the warlike Chechen Republic. I became the world's most generous donor. I built 20 oil and gas pipelines. My gas lights and heats the entire planet. I aid national liberation movements worldwide — supplying them with weapons at discounted prices. I distribute billion-dollar loans to poor countries and annul their debts a couple of years later. I give China my natural resources for a pittance. Thanks to my policies, the NATO bloc has significantly expanded its borders. I liberated the fraternal Ukrainian people from the tyranny of Zelensky's fascist regime. I stopped the bloody slaughter in Ukraine.

(An ad pops up on the screen: "Gas for every tomb! Let life never end!")

**Putin** (looks at the screen for a second, then continues with his statement):

— I launched the first man into space. My court composer wrote the immortal masterpiece "Swan Lake" [performs a few ballet steps to Tchaikovsky's music]. Finally, I rid the world of Hitler and his fascist dictatorship.
I toiled like a slave on a galley in the post of President for 50 years! I served a life sentence!
I lifted my country from its knees. I sold the factories to the workers and the land to the peasants. I created the world's number one army.
I extended a helping hand and protected Russian-speaking compatriots abroad from arbitrary treatment: in the Baltics, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. We safeguard the rights and freedoms of Russian diasporas across the entire former USSR.
Life expectancy in the country increased dramatically: I lived to be 98 years old.
Medicine is developing at a rapid pace: I died not from illness, but from boredom.
The patriotism of the younger generation is off the charts: my portrait hangs in every school classroom. Traditional values are taking root deep. We only have two-sex marriages. Divorces, abortions, condoms —  banned. Lesbians and gays — stripped of citizenship. Opponents and critics of the government — all in prison. On Earth, peace; among men — complete loyalty. Is this not an idyll? I have established an eternal celebration of life in my country.

**Osiris** (smiling broadly):

— Enough. You are the quintessence of virtue. The court will now retire to the deliberation room.

(Everyone remains seated.)

**Maat** (angrily):

— Wait! You are violating procedure again... The prosecution has not yet had its say!

**Osiris**:

— Dear Maat, all in due time. A time to gather stones, a time to listen to fables. When it's time for your fantasies [suddenly shouting], I will tell you! The court will now retire to the deliberation room!

(Everyone remains seated.)

**Osiris** (after a pause):

— Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please vote...

**Maat** (jumping up, brandishing her feathers):

— I object! The prosecution's case has not been heard! The weighing of the heart has not been conducted!

**Osiris** (sternly):

— Dear Maat, the defendant's heart was weighed in a special procedure. It has been found lighter than your feather. For it is as pure as the tear of an unborn infant! Anubis!

**Anubis** (producing a pre-prepared protocol from under his robe):

— The scales show zero point zero grams. Innocence is total and absolute.

(The scale pans suddenly begin to oscillate up and down spontaneously. Anubis grabs the pans, trying to balance them.)

**Osiris** (unperturbed):

— It's nothing: perturbations on the Sun. The mechanism appears to be... weather-dependent.

**Putin** (staring into the emptiness above the gods' heads):

— The machinations of Western partners led by NATO. They've even reached the Afterlife. Again, they are encroaching on our spiritual bonds.

**Osiris** (banging his staff on the floor):

— So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let's vote. Do you confirm the defendant's complete innocence?

**Jurors** (in unison):

— Yes!

**Zhirinovsky**:

— Clone him!

**Brezhnev**:

— Decorate him with an award!

**The Devil**:

— Canonize him!

**Stalin**:

— We are of the same blood!

**Beria**:

— I bow to you, Teacher!

**Mussolini**:

— Pleased to meet you, colleague!

**Dracula**:

— You know how to suck. Our kind of guy!

**Osiris** (ignoring Maat's protests):

— The court announces the verdict:
The defendant is acquitted.

**Maat** (waving a thick stack of photos in the air):

— Are you out of your minds? Here is the evidence! Murders! Abductions! Poisonings! Wars! Hybrid attacks! Falsifications!

(The evidence appears on the screen but almost instantly vanishes. The screen is covered with fine static. A minute later, an image of Putin against the backdrop of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior appears, immediately replaced by the cartoon "Dunno on the Moon".)

**Osiris** (smiling):

— Esteemed gods! Let's vote! All in favor of immortality, glory, and apotheosis for the defendant?

(All 42 gods raise their hands in unison. A commercial is broadcast: "The new 'Pharaoh-Deluxe' sarcophagus! Three colors: black granite, white marble, George ribbon.")

**Thoth** (reading from the clay tablet):

— Approved unanimously! Death is revoked, eternal life is granted! The name "Vladimir Putin" shall be inscribed on the title page of the "Book of the Dead" in golden ink!

**Putin** (nodding):

— I thank you. This is our shared victory. Special thanks to my faithful dog, Anubis. He's a good boy.

(Anubis wags his tail, embarrassed.)

**Maat** (in despair, dropping her feathers on the floor):

— Inconceivable! Unbelievable! I am filing an appeal with the Martian Intergalactic Court!

(She is dragged away under the arms by attendants with bear heads. The broadcast cuts out. The screen shows dancing Cossacks.)

**Thoth** (closing the case folder):

— Thank you all, you are free to go. The session is closed.

> **Culturological Commentary**
>
> The miniature is based on the ancient Egyptian myth of the Judgment of Osiris. According to the "Book of the Dead," the soul of the deceased was brought into the Hall of Two Truths, where it faced:
>
> — Osiris — god of the underworld, presiding judge.
>
> — Maat — goddess of truth and justice, the standard of purity.
>
> — Anubis — jackal-headed god who conducted the weighing of the heart.
>
> — Thoth — god of wisdom, court scribe.
>
> — 42 God-jurors — each responsible for one specific sin; the deceased had to swear before each god that he had not committed that sin.
>
> The main procedure — the weighing of the heart: the heart of the deceased was placed on one scale pan, and the feather of Maat on the other. If the heart was "lighter than the feather," the soul was deemed pure and granted eternal life; if heavier, it faced annihilation. This ritual symbolized absolute justice and the impossibility of deception.

— I repeat, as a true patriot of Russia: the Russian army has never bombed and will never bomb civilian targets. Our investigation shows that it was a clandestine workshop for sewing military uniforms.

**Journalist:**

— Children were among the victims...

And you will receive your reward in Heaven. Our latest Council has ruled: "Women’s education is a temptation from the Evil One."

**Putin**:

— Piece of cake. I rewrote the Constitution.

**Trump**:

— And nobody kicked you out?

**Putin**:

— We set the stage. Cooked up a “deadly virus,” rolled out a pandemic.
Scared the crap outta everyone, and boom — protest’s dead before it’s born.
Had martial law up my sleeve too, just in case. Didn’t even need it.
The opposition? Total losers. Weak as kittens. They were the ones yelling, “Lock us down harder!” Can you believe it?
Pathetic. Everyone just stayed home, shivering over their health.
So yeah, nobody gave a damn about the Constitution anymore.

**Trump**:

— Man, that’s insane. Genius! I’d love that too… But hey, we got this little thing called democracy.

**Putin**:

— I’d bend your democracy like a paper straw, Donnie.

**Trump**:

— C’mon, you serious?

**Putin**:

— Dead serious. First thing: trash the checks and balances. Straight to the dumpster. Build yourself a nice fat vertical.
Cops and Feds — your bodyguards. Courts — your backup.
And dirt, Donnie, dirt on everybody. No dirt? No problem. You plant it.
That’s how you run the show.

And remember: loyalty, loyalty, loyalty. Then purge, purge, purge.
Show trials — for the spectacle.
And boom, you’re untouchable.

Then you pump your gospel everywhere. Schools, TV, TikTok. “Make America Great Again” — tattoo it on every wall if you have to.

I’d brand the whole damn country:
TraMerica.
TrEconomics.
TraFashion.
Slap your name on everything — Americans love that crap.

Two parties? Forget it. Dems, Republicans — same circus, different clowns, just swap costumes every four years.
Start your own party: TrumParty. Big, loud, orange.

Hell, make your slogan bigger: MAGA — PTAGA.

I only locked him up.
For financial crimes.
A thief belongs in jail, Donnie. Am I right?

**Trump**:

— Then why did he die?

**Putin**:

— Fifteen chronic illnesses, Donnie. Even herpes. With a list like that, nobody lasts long.

**Trump**:

— That many? But he was still young!

**Putin**:

— That’s what my guys told me, Donnie.
Twenty conditions. Including prostatitis. Same people who worked the Magnitsky case — pros, real pros. My A-team.

**Trump**:

— Never heard of it. Not even Fox told me! Unbelievable!

**Putin**:

— We didn’t know either. But after the autopsy — boom! Twenty-five diseases. Even sciatica. Like some old wreck.

**Trump**:

— Incredible, just incredible. He looked like a healthy guy!

**Putin**:

— Donnie, if you don’t believe me, I’ve got the papers. Certificates, medical files, autopsy reports… all clean. Thirty conditions, Donnie. Including gallstones. He was rotten to the core.

**Trump**:

— Then how the hell did he even last three years in prison?

**Putin**:

— He had nine lives, Donnie. Like a cat. Not even “Novichok” could finish him off. Tough specimen.
Picture it — thirty-five chronic illnesses. Plus lice!
That wasn’t a man, that was a walking corpse!

**Trump**:

— Then why won’t you give the widow his stuff — documents, tapes ? If everything’s so clean?

**Putin**:

— Donnie, my guys are worried it’ll end up in German hands again. And you know how the Germans are — they can pull "evidence" out of thin air. We don’t need another "Novichok" fiasco.

**Trump**:

— And why do you keep changing the story? The cause of death? First it was arrhythmia, now it's poisoning?

**Putin**:

— Local screw-up. Some investigator out in Yamal. Wrote nonsense, couldn’t read between the lines.

(Pause):

**Putin**:

— It was clearly a tragic death caused by a rare cold-related allergy. Entirely natural, nothing suspicious at all.

**Trump** (aside, smirking):

— FSB's Tablets? Commandment #1: Deny the obvious.

(Pause)

**Trump** (to Putin, cheerful):

— Anyway, enough of this sad stuff. Let’s grab a beer for a cheer.

**Putin**:

— To us!

Case conference in psychiatric hospital. Three professors at table.

**First Professor**:

— The patient claims he is the Messiah.

**Second Professor**:

— What?! The Messiah?! Yesterday he thought he was Hitler!

**Third Professor**:

— Today he has a new mission: “Saving the Ukrainian brotherly people.”

**First Professor**:

— And how does he plan to pull that off?

**Second Professor**:

— As usual: bombings, killings, kidnappings.

**Third Professor**:

— Paranoid geopolitical delusions with a messiah complex…

**First Professor**:

— Pure lunacy, nothing more.

**Second Professor**:

— Colleagues, let’s avoid lyricism. A specific personality disorder.

**Third Professor**:

— The patient cries, saying: “Ukraine is our pain and tragedy.”

**First Professor**:

— And keeps droning on about some “root causes of the conflict” that “must be eliminated.”

**Second Professor**:

— And every five minutes hysterically shouts: “I want all of Donbas!”

**Third Professor**:

— Otherwise — cheerful, vigorous, active, recently met with this... character… in the red cap…

**First Professor**:

— Ah, the notorious “fireman,” the one who can stop wars with a single glance?

**Second Professor**:

— That’s him. A full 11 seconds shaking hands, then strolling down the red carpet, shamelessly flirting and winking.

**Third Professor**:

— Two of a kind, God forgive me! One raves about Donbas, the other about a Nobel Prize.

**First Professor**:

— Indeed, gentlemen. Vanity is a dangerous thing. It can end in a psycho-political disorder.

**Second Professor**:

— Colleagues! I think we clearly see a conflict of interests. Nothing good will come of this.

**Third Professor**:

— For Ukraine — absolutely.

**First Professor**:

— You’re right. Measures must be taken.

**Second Professor**:

— I suggest a drastic increase of haloperidol. Both oral and intramuscular.

**Third Professor**:

— It would also be advisable to prescribe calming baths of Ukrainian mud, accompanied by recordings of the "Crimea is ours!" shouts.

**First Professor**:

— And why not try electroshock therapy? Works wonders for specific disorders. The Ministry of Health already gave the green light.

**Second Professor** (solemnly):

— The Health Ministry  warns… Start acting like a brain-dead idiot, and you’ll get three thousand volts in the ass.

## 57. SHITTY IMMORTALITY

![](Images/En_Album_57.jpg)

Russia, Kremlin, President’s office. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mikhail Kovalchuk, his old friend, now overseeing life-extension research, at table.

**Putin** (almost affectionately):

– Well, Professor, report: how are things progressing with my immortality?

**Kovalchuk** (enthusiastically):

– There’s progress. Significant. We’re currently working on a project to preserve your... biological materials.

**Putin** (surprised):

– What? What does poop have to do with that?

**Kovalchuk** (hurriedly):

– Hold on. Don’t fuss. Hear me out first.

**Putin** (graciously):

– Speak.

**Kovalchuk**:

– Science has proven that freeze-drying excrement preserves intact DNA. We’ll freeze-dry and preserve your shit and pair it with a stack of photographs and a collection of your speeches. In the distant future, using your DNA and relying on your photos and samples of your public appearances, an exact replica of Vladimir Putin will be recreated. Probably 3D-printed. Well? What do you say?

**Putin** (pensively):

— Shitty immortality. A shitty idea. Say you print me out. But who am I? Nobody. Someone else will be sitting on the throne. They will immediately bring charges against me: the war, the arsons, the bombings, the cables, everything.

**Kovalchuk**:

— I don’t know about that. It’s impossible to predict what political system Russia will have by then.

**Putin** (with emphasis):

— That’s the point. I want a different kind of immortality. I want this — my present body — to serve me forever. Is that so hard?! Heart worn out — transplant. Liver, kidneys — transplant... It's as simple as that!

**Kovalchuk** (cautiously):

– But every organ has a service life – no more than eighty years...

**Putin**:

– Then take a heart from a schoolkid – a recent graduate. What, you feel sorry for some kid for my sake?

**Kovalchuk** (fervently):

– Not at all! I’d give you my own heart...

**Putin** (disgustedly):

– I don’t want yours. What the hell do I need your rusty junk for? Get me a young heart, with plenty of life left. And in 60 years, put in a new one. What’s so complicated?

**Kovalchuk**:

– At present, medicine can’t guarantee the organ will take. The probability of complications is quite high. So either wait another 20 years, or we preserve the shit.

**Putin** (grumpily):

– Fine, have it your way. Go on with your shit. But only as a backup. In the worst case, after my… death [his face distorted, as if in severe pain] it’ll go under the hammer for a million.

**Kovalchuk** (smiling):

– Yes. In the West, the shit of the powerful is highly valued. Some Italian artist, I think his name was Mandzoni, sold his poop for the price of gold. And now a 30-gram can of this shit costs hundreds of thousands of euros.

**Putin** (contemptuously):

– Well, if some lousy Italian shat gold ingots – my shit will go for ten million!

**Kovalchuk** (flatteringly):

– Maybe even more!

**Putin**:

– Only one condition: no greed! 30 grams?! That’s a laughingstock! What am I, a pigeon?

**Kovalchuk** (convincingly):

– You? No. You are a falcon. An eagle. A kite. A pterodactyl.

**Putin** (arrogantly):

– Exactly. And my shit must be of the highest quality. Refined. Deodorized. And make it blue. Blue blood – blue shit.

**Kovalchuk**:

– Of course, of course. First press. Virgin Putin shit. Or Putin virgin shit? Which is correct?

**Putin** (with hatred):

– Dismissed!

## 58. BLESSED ARE COPULATORS...

![](Images/En_Album_58.jpg)

Russia, Moscow, State Duma hall. 
Deputy Valentina Bebienko speaks from podium:

– Dear deputies! The President has set us the task of reviving great Russia tripling the birth rate. I won’t deny  it – the task is not easy. It's a difficult task. A super difficult one. But we are obliged to fulfill it. Because our president wants us to. I propose we approach the problem creatively. Of course, our target audience is young people. Under 30. After 30, influencing one's consciousness is not so easy. Mental patterns are already formed, and resistance to the state narrative is observed.

Now let's remember our own sad childhood. How did we satisfy our... needs – the perfectly legitimate urges of puberty? Secretly, stealthily, in dark stairwells on dirty windowsills, in damp basements, on dusty attics, or simply, God forgive me, in the park behind a bush. And always in tension: what if someone sees? What if the neighbors report us? And if, God forbid, you got caught – they drag you to the police, write a report, call your parents. In a word, shame for the rest of your life. 

This is wrong, comrades. This doesn't agree with the state demographic policy. Let's correct this imbalance. Let's give our children and grandchildren a happy childhood. Just as there used to be a phone booth on every corner – now in its place there will be a beautiful and tidy "reproduction pavilion". With surveillance cameras for facial recognition – we will award participants social bonuses on the "State Services" internet-portal. 
Inside – a spacious room with 4 double beds, a large TV on the wall. A film library with inspiring videotapes and soap operas. A cupboard with Viagra and accessories. Everything is high-style, clean, and attractive – from the cheerful wallpaper  to the playful patterns on the bed linen. 

And on the steps, instead of a doorman – a priest, sprinkling holy water on those entering, and with a blessing:
"Blessed are the copulators... in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit... in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 666..."

And after nine months, the system will automatically assess performance. If the birth of a child is confirmed, the parents will receive a one-time payment. In case of a male child, the amount will be doubled — in accordance with the state program for the militarization of demographic policy.

## 59. ONE HEAD FOR CROWN,  THE OTHER  RULES THE COUNTRY

![](Images/En_Album_59.jpg)

*Note: Illustration blocked by censorship.*

Spacious conference hall. Officials  seated inside. On illuminated stage well-known political leader lies on his back. His genitals fully exposed; his erect penis crowned with miniature, yet precise, copy of his own head. Small head of lying politician addresses audience with loud, pompous speech:

— The birth rate in the country is falling catastrophically. Like a stone dropped into an abyss. I've been long saying it and I repeat: condoms and abortions are to blame for everything! And LGBT. And Childfree. We must fight, fight, and fight against all this heresy. So far, we are doing poorly.

We banned abortions. So what? Now they go to China to have abortions. Or they give birth in Argentina and stay there for ever. Condoms are the utmost evil. Condoms are a personal insult to me. They violate the basic right of the individual — the right to procreate and multiply. Enshrined in the Constitution, by the way.

We banned condoms having named them  symbols of  extremism. So what? The black market for condoms is thriving. Underground manufactories of rubber goods are springing up like mushrooms after rain. All over the country. LGBT propaganda is oozing out of every crack. What is happening? This is a complete failure of my decrees implementation. I will not put up with this attitude.

If the state apparatus cannot force the population to give birth — I will force the state apparatus to give birth.

Turn on your brains, if any.
And start working.

Do we not have a sperm bank? Do we not have an egg bank?
Buy eggs from the population at a fixed price. Introduce a natural tax, for god's sake— one egg per month in favor of the state.

Engage the Academy of Sciences — let them create a state military Incubator. We will raise true patriots of our country. Who from their swaddling clothes will have memorized the military charter and the 10 commandments of Putinism. We will protect them from the pernicious influence of liberal parents. This will be the stronghold of our future prosperity and triumph.
Second. Engage the geneticists. The country does not need idle housewives and thinkers of any kind. The genes of future generations must be the right ones: patriotic, male, warlike.
Is it really so difficult? Get to work.

We will revive our great country and our great "second army of the world." Moreover, we will make it the first! Whatever the price.  Over the corpses of our enemies, through the tears of mothers, across the ravaged land — we will advance without fear and without mercy. We will crush any resistance and completely destroy anyone who dares to rise up against us. Even if it means bringing the entire country to its knees, we will do it. Make no mistake: the will of the state is iron, and nothing and no one can stop it.

(Stormy, prolonged applause.)

## 60. CULTURAL INFILTRATION OPERATION 

![](Images/Fr_Album_60.jpg)

Russia. Moscow. State Duma hall.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin is speaking to the deputies.

**Putin:**

— Esteemed deputies! Friends! Comrades!
The geopolitical situation has reached a boiling point. Russia’s enemies are not sitting idle. The West is doing everything in its power to destroy us. Especially Europe. Especially France. France has always been and remains our main adversary. France has constantly encroached on our traditional values, trying to destroy our cultural heritage and our language. Let us recall the 19th century, when, as a result of a French influence operation, the entire Russian elite spoke exclusively in French for decades. The Russian language found itself on the verge of complete oblivion and extinction. And if it weren’t for the deep Russian people, who quite rightly hated everything French, we would all now be speaking in French!

Yes, in the 19th century French intelligence failed, but now they are trying to take revenge.
Our enemies accuse us of allegedly waging a hybrid war against the West. Brazen lies! We are peaceful people. But the French truly do attack our culture, our traditional values, our language again and again. They have infiltrated the Russian language with a massive enemy landing force. Just look at how many French words we have — words so cleverly disguised that people don’t even suspect their speech is packed with French spy-words.

Chauffeur, tableau, theatre, chef-d’œuvre… There are thousands of them. It’s no longer clear whether it’s still Russian or already a dialect of French.
Well, the word “chauffeur” is nothing. But they're sneaking such destructive words as "president" and "revolution" into our language! This is nothing but blatant sabotage and an assault on our traditional values. What is this “president”? Russia has never had and never will have “presidents.” Only a tsar [pounds his chest]. Or take “revolution.” Revolutions and guillotines for royal families are purely French socio-political phenomena, absolutely alien to the Russian spirit. And by the way, we never had these abominations — until these shameful sabotage-words entered our language.

And this makes sense, comrades. Remember the Bible: “In the beginning was the Word.” And only after that — everything else. Meaning: there can be no revolution until the word “revolution” exists in the language. For example. In the Soviet Union there was no sex — this is a well-known fact. Why? Because there was no word “sex.” But once the opportunist Mikhail Gorbachev opened the borders to Western mass culture, the words “sex,” “gay,” “lesbian,” “LGBT” entered — and after that, debauchery and sodomy blossomed in Russia.

The conclusion, comrades: if we want to eradicate a phenomenon alien to our culture, we must erase from the language the very word that denotes it. Ban it by law, rewrite dictionaries, burn all books containing that word. All violators must be prosecuted.

And our so-called “linguists,” who shyly call these spy-words “borrowings”? This is sabotage, comrades, and we must stop it. First these sabotage-words assimilate, then they begin to multiply, and eventually they drive out the original Russian words. This is linguistic aggression, comrades. Linguistic genocide.
Justifying French borrowings in the Russian language must legally be equated to justifying terrorism. From five years to life imprisonment, depending on the particular word.

For neutral words (chauffeur, revanche, chef-d’œuvre, theatre) — five years.
For “revolution” (undermining the constitutional order) — ten years.
For “president” (discrediting the national leader) — fifteen years.

But the most insidious French sabotage-word is “condom.” We have seen with our own eyes how, after linguistic expansion, our market was literally flooded with these devilish rubber products. French ones, by the way. This unprecedented attack is aimed at the most valuable thing we have — our gene pool. This is a demographic atomic bomb, comrades. To destroy Russians even before they are born. This is the most blasphemous, the most sophisticated weapon of mass destruction.

The word “condom” must be erased from the Russian language. We must uproot it from our lives. The use of this word in any form is an act of high treason. In its highest manifestation. The depiction of a condom must be equated with displaying extremist symbols.

And in the future.
Comrades! We must strictly protect our language from the penetration of Western sabotage-words. This is the main defensive line in our struggle for traditional values.

Thank you for your attention!

## 61. GEOPOLITICAL SANDBOX
*Unfinished Mini-Play*

![](Images/All_Album_61.jpg)

Seven boys are playing in the Sandbox:
 Bully, Jew, and five others. Each boy is special, each wears a unique headpiece: a red cap, a white cap, a bucket hat, a peaked cap, a hat.
 

**ACT 1**

The Boys in the Sandbox

**HAT**:

— News, everyone! The Bully has started another fight.

**WHITE CAP:**

— With whom this time?

**HAT**:

— The Jew.

**WHITE CAP** (sternly):

— Bully, stop it immediately! Disrupting order in the Sandbox is unacceptable!

**BULLY**:

— And who are you to give me orders?

**WHITE CAP:**

— I am the Sandbox monitor. I am the moral authority.

**BULLY**:

— And I am the criminal Authority. I don’t care about your rules. I have a special path and special moral values.

**PEAKED CAP** (cautiously):

— And what's the fight about anyway? What are you arguing over?

**BULLY:**

— He grabbed my land!

**WHITE CAP:**

— Since when is it yours?

**BULLY**:

— It’s always been mine. My great-grandfather’s ashes are buried there!

**HAT**:

— But we agreed on the inviolability of borders! Your Uncle Boris put his signature on it!

**BULLY**:

— Boris was a fool and an alcoholic. Therefore, the deal is declared null and void! It’s my land. End of discussion.

(The Bully walks up to the Jew and punches him in the chest.)

**JEW**:

— Help! He’s killing me!

**HAT**:

— Hang in there, little guy! We’ll pass a Resolution right now. First. We fully condemn this aggression! And we call on all parties to exercise restraint.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— Second. We recognize the Jew’s legitimate right to defend his territory by any means necessary.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— Third. We call on the Bully to respect the established order and immediately cease the conflict.

**WHITE CAP:**

— Should we maybe actually help him?

**BULLY** (making a scary face):

— Just you try! You’ll get a black eye!

**HAT**:

— Such statements are unacceptable! Personally, I find them concerning.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— And disconcerting.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— Guys, we need to be careful with him. Don’t forget: he has a bulldozer.

**BULLY**:

— Spot on! I’ll bring my bulldozer and smash this whole Sandbox to splinters!

(He hits the Jew again.)

**JEW** (in a whisper):

— He’s killing me.

**HAT**:

— My concern has increased many times over.

**PEAKED CAP**:

— My disconcertment is growing exponentially.

**WHITE CAP:**

— I heard that his so-called bulldozer is all rusted out and won’t start.

**BUCKET HAT** (with doubt in his voice):

— We don’t know for sure, what if he fixed it and installed new spark plugs?

**HAT**:

— We must be prudent. Let’s not anger him.

**BUCKET HAT**:

— But it’s obvious: as soon as he finishes off the Jew, he’ll attack the rest of us!

**PEAKED CAP:**

— I am, of course, a bit farther from him, and across the strait, but still, my knees are trembling with fear. Here’s an idea: let’s help the Jew, but just a little bit and secretly. That way the Bully won’t notice.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— The main thing is not to give too much. If the Bully starts losing ground, he’ll get angry. And then he’ll definitely bring his bulldozer and raze the entire Sandbox to the ground.

**HAT**:

— Correct. Let them fight. While the Bully is busy with this brawl, we can sleep soundly.

**WHITE CAP:**

— Excellent plan. We’ll do just that.


**ACT 2**

The New Monitor

A boy in a red cap, holding a golf club, approaches the Sandbox.

**RED CAP:**

— So, what do we have here? A complete mess. It’s all your fault, you foolish old man. Get out of the Sandbox! Your time is up. I’m the monitor now.

**WHITE CAP:**

— Fine. I’m leaving. I did all I could. Good luck with this conflict!

**RED CAP:**

— That’s not why I came. I came to get the Gold Peacemaker Medal. You, with your stupid decrees, only fueled this fight. I came to stop it. You’re a fool, and I’m smart. That’s the whole difference between us. Get out and stop bothering me.

(White Cap leaves.)

**JEW** (looking at the new monitor with hope):

— You will help me, right?

**RED CAP** (sternly):

— So many fine young men have fallen! Beautiful, splendid young men! And all because of you. Why did you let yourself be dragged into this conflict?

**JEW** (stunned):

— I let myself?! He was the one who started it!

**RED CAP**:

— And didn’t you see he’s a thousand times stronger than you? A normal person doesn’t pick a fight with a superior opponent. You should have negotiated right away, not escalated the conflict.

**JEW**:

— But I couldn’t just give him the land! My constitution doesn’t allow it.

**RED CAP**:

— Don’t give me that! You have no cards. You didn’t give it up then, you’ll give it up now. Don’t give it up now, you’ll give it up in a year. Same difference. Only another half a million fine boys will end up in the grave.

**JEW**:

— But that’s not fair! You should help me defeat him instead.

**RED CAP** (with condemnation):

— How much help did the old man give you? Billions in coins. You didn’t even say thank you. You just kept whining and begging for more. And then — where is it all? What happened to those billions?

**JEW**:

— I’m ashamed to admit it, but... they were a bit embezzled. It just happened. It’s not my fault!!!

**RED CAP:**

— You have to pay back all those billions to me. I heard significant deposits of rare-earth metals have been found on your plot? They belong to me now.

**JEW** (agitated):

— This is robbery!

**RED CAP**:

— You thought you’d get a free ride? That’s not how things are done. Sign here.

**JEW**:

— But I’m not authorized. I need parliamentary approval...

**RED CAP**:

— Oh, really?! Hey, Steve, call the guys — tell them to hold back our intel.

**JEW** (desperately):

— Not the intel! I beg you!

**RED CAP:**

— So, are you signing or not?

**JEW** (dejectedly):

— I’m signing.


**ACT 3**

The Same Characters

**RED CAP:**

— So, we begin the peace process. I demand an end to this fight. Bully, state your terms.

**BULLY**:

— He must give me two regions. Throw half of his toy soldiers in the trash. And renounce joining any military blocs.

**RED CAP:**

— Hmm... Not bad. Jew, do you agree?

**JEW** (firmly):

— Over my dead body.

**BULLY** (with a gloating smirk):

— That can be arranged.

**RED CAP:**

— Enough with your jokes! Jew, what’s the problem?

**JEW**:

— He wants me to give him the land without a fight. That’s absurd! There’s no precedent for that in military history.

**RED CAP:**

— Why do you need so much land? Half your population has emigrated.

**JEW**:

— I can’t. Society is against voluntary cession of territory.

**RED CAP:**

— Hey, Steve! Hold back our intel!

**JEW** (hurriedly):

— Alright, alright. I agree, but I demand thorough detailing of the specifics.

**RED CAP:**

— What about the toy soldiers? And renouncing military blocs?

**JEW**:

— In that case, I need ironclad security guarantees — in case the Bully tries to take more of my land. Who will protect me? And how?

**RED CAP:**

— I’m giving you a personal guarantee: in case of renewed aggression, we’ll... figure something out. A 100% guarantee.


**ACT 4**

The Same Characters

**RED CAP:**

— I’m doing everything possible to reconcile these brawlers. I’ve tried every means. But the peace process is somehow stalled.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— You’re the best negotiator — strict but fair. Can I call you “Daddy”?

**HAT**:

— The perfect nickname! Daddy! We are in awe of your diplomatic skill! However, one can’t help but notice that you’re putting pressure on the Jew while fully supporting the Bully’s demands.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— Daddy! We would recommend putting pressure on the Bully as well — for example, you could give the Jew weapons. You promised! But for some reason, you aren’t...

**HAT**:

— It seems Daddy is afraid of the Bully’s bulldozer.

**RED CAP:**

— The bulldozer is a bluff. The Bully is pulling our leg. I’m not afraid of the bulldozer. What I am truly afraid of is that he’ll sneak up from behind, splash gasoline on my trousers, and set them on fire.

(Hat, Peaked Cap, and Bucket Hat exchange meaningful glances and giggle nervously.)

**RED CAP:**

— What’s so funny? Your pants are just as vulnerable to him as mine are! So I advise you to think long and hard before giving weapons to the Jew. Personally, I wash my hands of it.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— Well, then you could impose secondary sanctions on the Bully.

**RED CAP:**

— Sanctions are a debatable matter. First, I don’t want to scare him away from the negotiations. Right now, the Bully is meeting me halfway, and we should value that. Second, he has the world’s largest reserves of rare-earth metals. Why should I quarrel with him if I intend, after peace is concluded, to trade and jointly develop those unique deposits? And besides: my personal friendly relationship with the Bully is the key to future peace in the Sandbox.

(Pause.)

**RED CAP:**

— As for you three — I have major grievances with you! Do you think I’ll come to your rescue when the Bully attacks you? Don’t even hope. Enough of freeloading off me! You’re big boys and must learn to defend yourselves. You need to increase your defense spending to 5 percent of your GDP. That’s an order!
And stop this idiotic immigration! Just look at yourselves in the mirror, see what you’ve become. Where has all your aristocratic bearing, your moral values, your faith gone? You’re destroying your own identity with your own hands. If things continue like this — our friendship will be over!


**ACT 5**

The Same Characters

**RED CAP:**

— So, to summarize. The thirteenth round of talks was sabotaged by the Jew — forcing me to kick him out of the Oval Office. The fourteenth round was sabotaged by the Bully, because, apparently, his plane number one got lost in a labyrinth of clouds.

**BULLY** (casually):

— That’s exactly what happened — the Jew disabled all my navigation systems!

**RED CAP:**

— Fine, whatever! Let’s schedule a date for the next round. And no more nonsense! I propose next Thursday.

**JEW**:

— Won’t work for me — I have Shabbat.

**RED CAP:**

— Then Friday.

**BULLY:**

— Christ was crucified on a Friday.

**RED CAP:**

— Then Saturday, Sunday, Monday...

**BULLY** (shaking his head negatively):

— A three-day mourning period has been declared nationwide...

**RED CAP** (furious):

— Then today! Now! This minute!
I demand that you make peace! Sit down at the negotiating table!

(Red Cap pulls out a folding table and two chairs from behind his back.)

**RED CAP:**

— My pleasure! Have a seat!

**BULLY**:

— Well, now! My chair has gone missing. This is direct sabotage of the negotiation process. I can’t negotiate standing up!

**JEW**:

— And a leg broke off my chair! It’s all the Bully, his tricks!

(Waves a chair leg in the air.)

**RED CAP** (wearily, with a martyred expression):

— The fifteenth round of negotiations is concluded. The dialogue was productive but difficult. We eagerly await the next meeting. There’s a good chance of reaching an agreement before Thanksgiving.

## 62. OUTRAGEOUS!  ENEMIES PLUNDERING  RUSSIAN LANGUAGE!

![](Images/En_Album_62.jpg)

Russia, Moscow, the Kremlin. Meeting of Russian Security Council. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking.

**Putin:**

— Comrades! 

Today is a momentous day. Today, we have identified and formulated our third — and most important — goal of the Special Military Operation. Thus, from this moment on, I ask you to memorize our three strategic goals in the fight against the fascist Ukrainian regime:

 • Demilitarization

 • Denazification

 • Decolonization (of the Russian language)

Comrades!

It is with deep sorrow that I inform you: we have been struck by a catastrophe of cosmic proportions. For centuries, the enemy has been weaving a deadly web behind our backs, insidiously and secretly, and now we have found ourselves caught in it — completely unexpectedly.

Comrades!

We pay the utmost attention to protecting our spiritual and family values. This is wonderful! However, we have completely lost sight of our traditional communicational values. Both semantic and phonetic.

After all, our language — our national treasure — has for centuries  been subjected to predatory raids by the Ukrainian language! They steal our traditional, primordial Russian words, mutilate them by changing their phonetic form and semantics, and use them in their language without our consent!

They have stolen our prefixes and endings; they have stolen our nouns, adjectives, and verbs. They radically change their meaning; they mangle their pronunciation. This is a violation of the copyright of our intellectual property! We gave them no permission to do that. This is a criminal offense and grounds for compensation.

But it is also a desecration of the Russian language. It is genocide of our linguistic heritage. It is a humiliating spit in our souls.

Comrades! 

Before me lies a three-volume work compiled by our chief linguist and renowned expert on the Russian language — Vladimir Dal. It contains all the original Russian words stolen from our language by the Ukrainians — words that have been humiliated and insulted, turned into speechless slaves in the service of the communications of the Ukrainian fascist mob.

I do not wish to be unsubstantiated, comrades. I will give you dozens of examples of how our noble, authentic Russian words have been rudely and unceremoniously raped, violated, and forced into the alien structure of the so-called Ukrainian language.

• Take the Russian word ***ubit'*** (to kill). They snatched it and turned it into ***vbiti***. This is a discredit: one can vbit' (drive) a nail into a board, but fascists are to be killed (ubit').

• Take the Russian word ***tol'ko*** (only). They turned it into ***til'ky***.To a Russian ear, it sounds offensive. Furthermore, it's noteworthy that they use the hostile NATO letter **i** here. With a dot! Completely alien to our intellectual values. Did you know that there is an even more vile letter in the Ukrainian language: **ï**, with two dots! It is a clear symbol of degradation and the quintessence of fascist rhetoric.

• Take the Russian word ***chelovek*** (person). They turned it into ***cholovik***, and on top of that, they changed its meaning. According to their twisted logic, only men belong to the category of "people." That is, women are not people? This discredits the entire female half of humanity. What disrespect for Russian women!

• Take the Russian word ***narushat'*** (to violate). They changed everything in it: the prefix, the suffix, the ending. What did they get? A disgusting hybrid: ***porushuvaty***. This is an insult to the feelings of those who believe in the beauty and grandeur of the Russian language.

• Take the Russian word ***laska*** (caress). Kind, sweet, innocent, and warm. They have put it to use in the service of blatant propaganda for sexual games and debauchery! Just look at it! ***Bud' laska!*** For them, this supposedly means ***please***. "Bud' laska, go to the store." "Bud' laska, make an omelet." And so on. Every minute we hear this ***bud' laska***. But it is nothing more than an invitation to sexual foreplay: 

***bud' laska = caress me!***

This is sexual harassment in its purest form!

• And what about the word ***shkodit'*** ? We know that it means very bad behaviour. But they stole it and — to annoy us — elevated and refined it. For them, it means ***to damage***: "Do not ***poshkod'*** the bag!" How are we supposed to take this? This is discrediting of our very meanings, comrades. Sacred meanings.

What don't they do with our words!

• They rearrange letters in historically established combinations: we say ***rozhdayetsya*** (is born), they say ***narodzhuyetsya***. We have **zhd** they have **dzh**. This is a pure mockery of our language.

 • We say ***vsyo*** (all/everything), they say ***usyo***.

 • We say ***ulitsa*** (street), they say ***vulytsya***.

•  We say ***krestit'sya*** (to cross oneself), they say ***khrestytysya***. They are simply mimicking us! Like monkeys in a zoo.

•  And the good old word ***kakoy-nibud'*** (any/some)? They simply mutilated it! They castrated it and swapped the parts of the compound word. What did they get? Gibberish, abracadabra: ***bud'-yakiy***.

And so on and so forth. I repeat, I have in my hands three thick volumes listing all crimes of this nature.

We turned to experts, who came to the conclusion that this phenomenon is nothing less than the colonization of the Russian language with the aim of discrediting, humiliating, parodying, abusing, insulting, causing serious damage to its structural elements and, ultimately, destroying it.

Therefore, comrades, a new task stands before us. After four years of selfless struggle, we have achieved the goals of demilitarization and denazification of the so-called Ukraine. Now we are faced with an equally important task — the decolonization of the Russian language.

We must wrest our desecrated words from the clutches of the fascists, return them to their native harbor, and rehabilitate them.

And we are filing a counterclaim against Ukraine in the International Tribunal for compensation for reputational and linguistic damage. You want to use our words?  Obtain written permission and pay royalties. But we will not tolerate any violence, abuse, or disrespect for our linguistic symbols and their sacred meaning.

**Security Council Secretary N. Patrushev:**

— Vladimir Vladimirovich! I propose that we offer the opposing side a mutual settlement of our claim and  Ukraine's claim against Russia for material damage from military actions. We will demand compensation for the same amount — 800 billion euros.

**Putin:**

— Very good suggestion! Thank you! Thus, we win twice. We razed to the ground half of their country, but at the same time we do not pay a penny in reparations.

## 63. SCIENTIFIC FOUNDATIONS OF PROPAGANDA

![](Images/En_Album_63.jpg)

Russia, Moscow, the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses journalists of the Kremlin press pool.

**Putin**: 

— Comrades! Today, I would like to touch upon the bedrock principles of Russian state ideology. Our enemies accuse us of — how shall I put it —distorting ideas and facts, of turning concepts, principles, and faith upside down. In the public sphere, the term "mendacious propaganda" is frequently leveled against us.

This is unjust, comrades. It is a blatant lie and a baseless insinuation. We invent nothing, and we shall tolerate no "creative ad-libbing". Our ideology is based on a strictly scientific approach. Much like Marxism-Leninism, our ideology flows logically from the world-renowned theories of the greatest thinkers of human civilization.

If the three pillars of Communist teaching were Marx, Engels, and Lenin, then the three pillars of our ideology are Hegel, Einstein, and Orwell.

Dialectics and the Theory of Relativity provide the scientific basis for the structural framework of our ideology. The novel "1984" is a brilliant example of the substantive application of that very structure.

Our world rests upon fundamental laws:

• Universal Gravitation

• Unity and Struggle of Opposites (Hegel)

• General Theory of Relativity (Einstein)

Yes, dear comrades, everything in this world is relative: good and evil are intertwined; antagonists live in symbiosis. Read your Hegel. Remember your Einstein.

Take, for instance, war and peace. The brilliant visionary Orwell was the first to uncover the immutable truth: 

**PEACE IS WAR, WAR IS PEACE**

And indeed, look: there is currently peace between NATO and Russia. For now. I repeat: for now. But what is happening in reality? In reality, a full-scale hybrid war is underway (cyber-attacks, a war of ideas and meanings, draconian economic sanctions, the freezing of our financial assets, and so on). And this is what you call "peace"? I must specifically note the overtly hostile practice of regular NATO weapon deliveries to Ukraine. If NATO "HIMARS", even if launched from Ukraine, have decimated dozens of my strategically vital oil refineries — does that, in your view, qualify as peace?

On the other hand, conventional wars are peace in its embryonic stage. War leads nations to peace. Give people war, and they will immediately become ardent adherents of peace. War begets peace. No one desires peace more than the soldiers sitting in the trenches. These soldiers are not fighting for territory — they are fighting for peace. And the more brutal, bloody, and destructive a war becomes, the more solid and indestructible the peace born of that war will be. 

**WAR IS PEACE**, comrades. This is a fact. And it is a fact that must be reckoned with.

Another of Orwell’s brilliant discoveries is the axiom:

**TRUTH IS A LIE**

Indeed, the statement of any fact is subjective. Everything depends on the speaker’s point of view, on interpretation, and ultimately — on the definition of concepts. But conceptual frameworks can (and must!) differ across various cultures. 

For example, Europe has its own notions of duty, morality, and spiritual values; we have ours. By virtue of this alone, we cannot share the same interpretation of facts. What they call the truth is, for us, a lie. And vice versa. It is self-evident.

As for the so-called "rewriting" of history: this too is obvious, comrades. Scientific and technological progress is fundamentally changing our lives, our perceptions, and our views — changing them right before our eyes. We now have dozens of times more information at our disposal than we did, say, ten years ago. Artificial Intelligence offers immense opportunities for a more adequate analysis and understanding of history. Because of this, we must, of course, adapt textbooks for students and schoolchildren. This is the natural consequence of the total informatization of the society in which we live.

Furthermore, the dialectical approach leads us to the recognition of an obvious truth: 

**DEFENSE IS OFFENSE**

Take, for example, our heroic Special Military Operation. Yes, today it is already a full-fledged war. A war for peace throughout the world. But let us recall how it all began. NATO was openly preparing an invasion of our country by the Ukrainian army. If we had not entered the territory of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, we would be defending ourselves against the enemy on our own soil right now. We acted wisely — we delivered a preemptive retaliatory strike. In doing so, we saved thousands of lives and hundreds of civilian facilities from death and destruction. As you can see: 

**OFFENSE IS DEFENSE**

In its purest form.

And so, comrades, let us summarize. The most important front of our confrontation with the West is the ideological one. In your professional activities, you must not only disavow enemy propaganda — you must be able to prove to the electorate the scientific validity of our state ideology. I have provided you with several compelling examples. This is the foundation, which you may develop and deepen indefinitely.

To work, comrades! 

Victory will be ours!

## 64. PUTIN’S HANDBOOK: "1984" REVISITED

![](Images/All_Album_64.jpg)

Russia, Moscow, the Kremlin. Meeting of the heads of state security and law enforcement agencies. President of Russia Vladimir Putin speaking.

**Putin**: 

— Comrades! Who among you has read the seminal work of the great British writer **George Orwell**, "**1984**"? No one? You should. It is our handbook.

Dear comrade Orwell described a fairly effective totalitarian system of government. Of course, in the middle of the last century, he couldn't have even dreamed of the technologies we have at our disposal today. Because of this, his system is quite cumbersome, resource-heavy, and expensive. But regardless — it works perfectly! Even in conditions of technological backwardness.

But the main thing, comrades, is his immortal totalitarian ideas: ***doublethink***, the ***mutability of the past***, and the ***thought police***.

We have already adopted some things from his system and are applying them with great success. But, as they say, there is still room for improvement.

First and foremost, we must introduce the concept of ***thoughtcrime*** into our jurisprudence. This concept follows logically from our traditional values. Remember what Christ said in his sermons: if you have lusted after your brother’s wife, you have already committed adultery. Thus, according to the dogmas of our Orthodox Christian Church, the very thought of sin becomes a sin. This is an important metaphysical leap that we are simply duty-bound to put at the service of our state security.

So, we didn't invent ***thoughtcrime***, and neither did Orwell — it was invented by Lord God Himself.

What does this mean for us in practice?
First: a special unit must appear within the police — Thought Purity Department. Put simply, that very Orwellian ***Thought Police***.

Second: we must refine our criminal and administrative codes by introducing punishments for ***thoughtcrime***.
And most importantly — we must launch practical work among the population.

Let’s turn back to our handbook. In the mythical country of Oceania, dissenters were identified by establishing 24-hour surveillance over citizens using so-called ***telescreens***. Unlike Oceania, which, as I understand, had the status of a pariah on the international stage, Russia is one of the major geopolitical players and must maintain at least some semblance of basic decency. Therefore, we cannot openly violate such fundamental civil rights as the right to privacy.

Furthermore, ***telescreens*** are effective tools of intimidation, but uncovering secret thoughts requires clandestine methods. No one will confess to heresy if they know they are being monitored.

We have already taken a large — a huge — step in this direction: we developed and implemented the mandatory messenger MAX, which allows us to covertly monitor our citizens' communications. 

But! When a foreign agent goes to a protest, stands in a solo picket, or publishes unpatriotic appeals on the internet — that is already an advanced stage of ideological deviation. That can no longer be cured; it can only be punished with imprisonment.

In fact, you know, I suggest viewing dissent as a progressive disease. If we manage to diagnose it at an early stage, there is a very good chance that, with the help of basic corrective procedures, we can cure a person of this illness forever.

Therefore — our attention must be directed primarily at children. Yes, our "Talks about the Important things" are already standard practice across the country. This is wonderful — we are instilling the correct mindsets in our children. But we need feedback! What do we have in this regard? Student surveys? They are absolutely ineffective; it’s like expecting a foreign agent to confess in front of a ***telescreen***.

We need a systemic, global solution. And it lies right on the surface. What will we do? We will install 24-hour audio surveillance in kindergartens, schools, and other educational institutions. Not video surveillance — no. That is expensive and unnecessary. We don’t need faces — only conversations and a voice recognition system. This is simpler and cheaper. And it can be done covertly.

Next, artificial intelligence analyzes the information coming to the server and produces the final result: "Petya Belkin from 3rd grade at School No. 212 is unreliable; yesterday during the break between the second and third lessons, he used an insulting remark directed at the President."

Petya is then handled by the juvenile department for painless ideological correction — much like the way a child’s teeth are straightened with braces when they grow in sideways.
And exactly like crooked teeth — in childhood, such ideological correction is still possible.

And by the way, when little Petya grows up, he will only be grateful to us for helping him get rid of wrong thoughts in his childhood and thereby saving him from prison.

Naturally, total audio surveillance should be carried out in all state institutions — we are not breaking any laws there. In coordination with private business owners, we will also install monitoring devices on their premises and in their offices. If they refuse to cooperate — well, you know how to persuade them.

Our ultimate goal, comrades, is to build a harmonious society — a society based on the principles of homogeneity, conformity, solidarity, and cohesion.

So that I no longer have to lie during a "Direct Line" with the people, claiming that foreign agents in Russia are not subject to criminal prosecution.

We won’t actually have to persecute dissenters — for the simple reason that we won’t have any dissenters left.

## 65.BLESSED ARE THE PEACEMAKERS...

![](Images/All_Album_65.jpg)

American bar. Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump at table, drinking beer.

**Trump**:

— This whole Ukraine mess is a total pain in my ass. Honestly, I almost wish I’d never gotten involved in your little spat. My time’s running out, and if I don’t snag a Nobel Peace Prize by then? They’ll call me the biggest loser, the most hated president ever. Total disaster.

(Pause)

**Trump (pleading):**

— Come on, Vova, why won't you help me out? I put every single point you asked for in the deal. Buddy, let's just sign this peace treaty already! It's a hell of a deal for you. And the best part? It gets me the glory I deserve.

**Putin (indifferently):**

— Donnie, I've got my own image to worry about. I need the Donbas, don't you get it? I’ve already enshrined it in the Constitution as legitimate Russian territory. And let's not forget: I've spilled a river of blood for that goddamn Donbas. I need to hand it to my voters on a silver platter. No Donbas, no victory. And that means every single sacrifice in this bloody war was for nothing.

**Trump (lowering his voice):**

— Listen, Vova, nothing's stopping you from picking this up again in a couple of years — just wait until I'm out, okay? Stage a Ukrainian attack on your residence. Out in Tver, in the nature reserve. But make it look good. If you’re gonna cry wolf, show a real wolf. The *Reichstag’s* gotta burn for real. Launch the drones from their side. Burn your favorite palace to the ground, take out a hundred hectares of ancient forest while you're at it. Show the cameras some dead endangered animals. Give people a story they can believe. A top-shelf casus belli.

**Putin (doubtfully):**

— But you're giving Ukraine security guarantees. If some nosy journalist digs it up and finds out it's a total setup, NATO could invoke Article 5 against me.

(Pause.)

**Putin (firmly):**

— I need ironclad guarantees, Donnie. Guarantees of impunity.

**Trump (nodding in agreement):**

— Of course. And you've got 'em, Vova. The best guarantees aren't the ones signed on paper; the best ones are a gentleman's handshake.
Just think back, Vova. After the USSR fell apart, Ukraine got "ironclad guarantees," right? And what happened? Did anyone lift a finger when you moved in? Hell no. So why would new "guarantees" be any different? Me? I won't get involved in your scrap with Ukraine no matter what. Especially if you put on a convincing enough show. Look at Obama, look at Biden—they were scared shitless of an open fight with Russia. America doesn’t go to war unless our interests are at stake.

**Putin (skeptically):**

— And Europe?

**Trump (contemptuously):**

— Europe? Give me a break. They’re not jumping into the fire. Not after you showed them your playbook: just throw more bodies at the problem. Mountains of corpses. The very sight of it makes Europe shake in its boots. Over there, they’re obsessed with human life. As for sending weapons, they'll keep feeding them to Ukraine just long enough to rebuild their own defenses. Did you think they're doing it out of the goodness of their hearts? Yeah, right. They're doing it so Ukraine takes the bullet for them. Guards Europe's border with its own blood.

So you've got zero reason to worry. Let's freeze the conflict along the current front line. For now. You take a breather and modernize your hardware. Your own economy's on its last legs! And in a couple of years, you come back with fresh troops.

**Putin:**

— And what do I tell my people?

**Trump:**

— What’s to tell? Mission accomplished. Denazification, demilitarization — done. The Donbas is "practically fully" liberated. Don't sweat the numbers. "Practically fully" sounds like a triumph. The rights of Russian speakers? Protected. What defeat? What are you talking about? It's a clear victory. Phase one. Then, after I get my Nobel and my term's over, you can finish the job and claim your total, final victory.
Come on, Vova! Don't be a stubborn prick! Let's sign the damn deal and be done with it!

## 66. FSB PLAYBOOK

### FSB PLAYBOOK, LESSON 1

**PERFORMANCE: FATAL ACCIDENT**

Russia, Moscow. A cozy apartment in a high-rise building. Relaxing comfortably in armchairs, two Russian intelligence officers discuss the details of an upcoming operation.

**SENKO** (cheerfully):

— Well, that’s it, Vechirko. The old bitch is a dead woman walking. We’ve finally pinned her to the map.

**VECHIRKO** (doubtfully):

— We’ve "pinned" her a hundred times, Senko. So what? She’s still out there, pedaling away like a marathon runner on steroids. Ten years, and we're still chasing a grandmother on a bicycle. It’s embarrassing.

**SENKO** (with a poisonous, self-satisfied smirk):

— The bicycle is exactly what’s gonna put her in the grave. Trust me.

**VECHIRKO**:

— Brakes again? Our guys in Georgia messed with her brakes dozens of times — she just fixes them. With a hairclip and a prayer.

**SENKO**:

— No, Vechirko, you’re thinking small. Georgia was flat ground compared to this. This time, gravity is our operative. As soon as she leaves that campsite and hits the main road, she’s on a hellishly steep descent. Without brakes, she’ll be carried down like an avalanche. Just a mile of pure, vertical acceleration. The main thing is just to make sure she sits in that saddle and gives it the first push. After that... physics does the rest.

**VECHIRKO**:

— And how the hell are you going to make her “sit in that saddle”? You know her — she’ll probably feel a loose bolt through her shoes and fix it on the spot.

**SENKO** (grinning): 

— That’s the beauty of it. Our "object" has a routine. When she leaves the grocery store with her supplies, she doesn’t even try to ride. The bike is loaded down with forty kilograms of gear. She just walks it like a pack mule.

**VECHIRKO** (with a snort of pure contempt): 

— Some "cyclist." If you can't handle a hill, stay home and rot in front of a TV.

**SENKO**:

— Exactly. Our guys hit the brakes while she was inside buying her cheap canned food. She won’t suspect a thing for the next three days, because there'll be no actual riding until then. She’ll only find out the brakes are gone when she goes back down to the city.

**VECHIRKO**:

— Even so, broken brakes are just a gamble. One lucky turn, one soft bush, and she’s alive again. There’s only one hairpin turn on that entire highway where a "fatal accident" would look convincing.

**SENKO**:

— Listen closely, rookie, and learn how a masterclass is run. We’re not leaving it to luck. We’ve already "staged" the theater. We’re faking road repairs right at the edge of the abyss. Look at this.

(Senko swivels a laptop around and brings up several high-resolution photos on the screen.)

**SENKO** (pointing at the screen): 

— We’ve placed two detour signs across the main asphalt: "City Center — Detour." There’s a gravel track branching off to the right, but the turn is a brutal 120 degrees.

![](Images/All_Album_66_1.jpg)

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Sharp enough to snap a neck.

**SENKO**:

 — If she’s stupid enough to try that turn at speed, she’ll lose traction and sail straight into the canyon. A hundred-meter drop. Guaranteed closed-casket funeral. But knowing her stubbornness, she’ll try to bypass the signs and stay on the highway. And that’s where the real symphony begins. Look.

(Senko clicks to the next photo.)

![](Images/All_Album_66_2.jpg)

**SENKO**:

— Ten meters past the signs, parked dead on the inner radius of a blind bend, we’ve got a heavy dump truck. It completely erases her line of sight. Because of the steep grade, everything beyond that bumper is a total void. Naturally, she’ll swerve left to get around it. But she won’t see the excavator and the second truck parked on the slope until she’s already committed. She’ll be boxed in.

**VECHIRKO** (fascinated): 

— The kill zone.

**SENKO**:

— Exactly. And here’s the masterpiece: in that one narrow corridor left open, a massive semi-truck will be barreling uphill, straight at her. Now, do the math. Her brakes are "failed." She’s a sixty-eight-year-old woman on forty kilos of steel, screaming downhill at forty, maybe fifty kilometers per hour.

![](Images/All_Albun_66_3.jpg)

**SENKO** (with a cold, triumphant grin): 

— At that speed, she’s not a rider anymore — she’s just a passenger on a one-way trip to hell. Even if she sees the trap at the last millisecond, what’s she gonna do? Lay the bike down? On that grade? She’ll hit the grill of that semi like a bug on a windshield. She won’t even have time to scream before she and that precious bicycle are flattened into a pancake. It’s a perfect, inescapable death trap, kid. Do you see the beauty in it now?

**VECHIRKO** (with visible relief): 

— Well, God willing. It’s about time she was six feet under. I don't get it — everyone else is normal. They get the message, they die quiet, no fuss. But this one? She kicks, she fights, she crawls back from the edge every single time. How many times do we have to prove it: if the Service wants you dead, you’re dead. Don’t resist, don't struggle — it’s just a waste of everyone’s time. You’re only dragging out the inevitable.

**SENKO** (rubbing his hands):

— Exactly. And finally, bro, we’ll get our hands on that million. Ten years of our lives wasted on one stubborn bitch... honestly, at this point, I think we’ve been working at a net loss.

### FSB PLAYBOOK, LESSON 2

**DEADLY MEDICINE: EYE DAMAGING DROPS**

Russia, Moscow. A cozy high-rise apartment. Relaxing comfortably in armchairs, two Russian intelligence officers talk shop.

**VECHIRKO** (bitterly): 

— This 21st-century medicine is a pain in my ass. All these patented, tenth-generation miracle drugs. Take the old hag, for instance. I blast her retinas with infrasound — a professional job — and what does she do? She just strolls into a pharmacy, buys some Italian drops with panthenol, and boom — problem solved! For her. For me? Months of calibration down the drain. It’s a joke.

**SENKO**:

 — Your problem, Vechirko, is that you see medicine as an obstacle. You need to see it as a goldmine. The doctor-patient bond is the ultimate vulnerability; people trust their physician more than their own mother. Our job is to weaponize that trust. With everything being digitized now — medical records, online portals — it’s child’s play.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Enlighten me.

**SENKO**: 

— You hit her eyes again — harder this time. Make her panic, make her see a doctor. When she books an appointment, we’re already there. We find the doctor, lay down a simple ultimatum: either he cooperates, or we leak the photos of him with his mistress to his wife. We have dirt on everyone, Vechirko. Always. You tell the doctor exactly what to prescribe. Something cheap — no point wasting the budget.

**SENKO** (enthusiastically): 

— While she’s waiting for her consultation, we seed every pharmacy in her radius with "special purpose" batches of that exact drug. We don't change the label; we just... tweak the chemistry. A double dose of boric acid, perhaps. Something aggressive. Every pharmacy gets a specific bottle, a photo of her face, and instructions.

**VECHIRKO** (narrowing his eyes): 

— You’re talking about modeling her entire reality.

**SENKO**: 

— Exactly! We induce the symptom, we predict the diagnosis, and we control the cure. We can plant a "trap" for her in every pharmacy in Moscow. Where is she gonna run? She has no choice. Unless she wants to haul her bony ass all the way to Tver for a bottle of Visine.

**VECHIRKO** (gloomily): 

— There’s one flaw in your "masterpiece," Senko. The old bitch doesn’t go to doctors. She doesn’t trust them. She treats herself.

**SENKO** (unfazed): 

— We have a protocol for that too: "Refusal of Sale." We make the drops prescription-only. No paper, no medicine.

**VECHIRKO** (with a dry, sarcastic laugh): 

— Yeah, we tried that in Tbilisi. You know what she did? She pulled out her phone and started filming the pharmacists. She made such a scene about "consumer rights" that they folded just to get her out of the shop. She walked out with her drops in the pocket.

**SENKO** (scowling, his tone darkening): 

— I heard. That’s why we tried the "discount" angle. We kept a "loaded" bottle of Systane for her in every pharmacy — 60% off. Who turns down a 60% discount?

**VECHIRKO**: 

— She does. She looked at the price, looked at the pharmacist, and insisted on buying the full-price bottle from the back shelf. The cunning old bat... she has a sixth sense for "gifts" from the Service.

**SENKO** (snarling): 

— God, I hate her. She’s an anomaly. Too smart, knows too much. Everyone else is a sheep — they trust the white coats, they fear the regulations, they die quietly with a smile of gratitude on their faces. But this one... she’s making us look like amateurs.

### FSB PLAYBOOK, LESSON 3

**INSTRUMENTALIZING TERROR: A BIRD CHORUS AT 100 dB**

Russia, Moscow. A cozy high-rise apartment. Relaxing comfortably in armchairs, two Russian intelligence officers talk shop.

**VECHIRKO**:

— So, what’s the word from the top? Did the brass like the "instrumentalized terror" bit? The digitized noise?

**SENKO**:

— They liked the concept. "A hell of a resource saver," they called it. But they don't pay us for concepts, Vechirko — they pay for corpses. We need flawless execution, and frankly, you’re nowhere near that.

**VECHIRKO**:

— Come on! Last year in Chamyuva, the old bitch was scared shitless when that "mountain beast" let out a roar outside her tent at exactly 9:00 PM. She’d grab a plastic bottle and crinkle it like a maniac to "scare it off." Since the loop was short, it stopped right on cue. She actually patted herself on the back, bragging to her diary about how she "knew how to commune with the wild."

**SENKO** (grudgingly): 

— Fine, that worked. A rare moment of competence. But in Georgia, you lost your mind with the decibels. If you’re mimicking nature, you can't ignore physics and zoology. You didn't give a damn, and now your birds don't sing — they scream like banshees at a hundred decibels.

**VECHIRKO** (defensively):

— But look at the outcome! She herself complained to her AI "assistant" that she spent three hundred sleepless nights in Georgia because of that "hellish chorus."

**SENKO**:

— Three hundred sleepless nights is a triumph of persistence, but the fact that she’s still breathing is a failure of tradecraft.

**VECHIRKO** (spitefully):

— Is it my fault the bitch is made of iron? Any normal "object" would’ve had a nervous breakdown or a stroke three times over by now.

**SENKO** (sternly):

— Spare me the drama, Vechirko. Do your "post-mortem" and learn. 

**VECHIRKO** (offended):

— It’s always my fault, isn't it?

**SENKO** (strictly):

— Listen, pal! You’re not the only smart one here. The old bitch isn’t an idiot either. Take those “crickets” of yours. First, they scream like banshees at a hundred decibels. Second — the transition to the silent phase. Look at the data: one half of the chorus stops instantly, at exactly 07:00:00. The other half — exactly 10 seconds later. You couldn't even sync the timers? That’s the bare minimum. And two devices for all this cacophony? Pathetic. You should have tried to mimic a natural process. In nature, crickets fall silent chaotically; they don’t have a conductor with a baton.

**VECHIRKO** (dejectedly):

— I thought the racket would drive anyone mad, and they wouldn’t notice the technical flaws.

**SENKO**:

— Maybe so. For “anyone” else. But we’re not dealing with just "anyone."  When it comes to the old bitch, factor in a tenfold increase. Ten times the brains, a hundred times the paranoia. She believes in nothing and trusts no one.

**VECHIRKO**:

— I know! That’s why I’m constantly rotating the devices. Modifying the soundscapes, expanding the “repertoire.”

**SENKO** (smirking):

— Focus on the fundamentals, rookie. Your "barking dog" goes on for three hours from a fixed GPS coordinate. That’s a fatal flaw.  Real life doesn’t work like that. Dogs move. They run, they jump. Even assuming the dog is on a chain — a rare sight in Tbilisi — it still moves, and its bark creates a dynamic acoustic signature. But you? You just looped a low-grade fragment on infinite repeat. It’s a "dead" sound. Low-grade garbage.

(Pause.)

**SENKO**:

— Same with the cars. A deafening engine roar is a solid concept, but execution is everything. In the real world, you have the Doppler effect — the pitch shifts as it approaches and fades. Yours was just thirty seconds of static roar suspended in mid-air. And, predictably, she noticed that during the day, not a single car can be heard in that Vake park. She’s not just listening, she’s analyzing.

**VECHIRKO** (ominously):

— Fine. You want authenticity? I’ll give her authenticity. Next time, I’ll crank up the rustling of leaves to a hundred decibels. I’ll make a falling leaf sound like a jackhammer.

**SENKO** (winces):

— There you go again. Pure emotion. I don’t need your tantrums; I need results. Stop messing around and get to work.

### FSB PLAYBOOK, LESSON 4

**FSB GOLD STANDARD: MULTI-STEP GAMBIT**

Russia, Moscow. A cozy apartment in a high-rise building. Relaxing comfortably in armchairs, two Russian intelligence officers discuss the details of an operational plan.

**SENKO**:

— The multi-move gambit… it’s our Gold Standard. We don’t wait for favors from nature — we manufacture reality ourselves. First, we create a problem for the old bitch, then we "plant" the solution. And as a bonus, we provide the "motivation." Our "Poisonous Mattress" operation is a beautiful rigged game where the entire deck is marked. The first stage — creating the problem — is done. By the way, were there any hiccups?

**VECHIRKO** (animatedly):

— You bet! The damn witch always finds a way to make things difficult. We were trying to puncture her mattress from the outside, through the tent floor. We were stabbing away with an awl for at least half an hour. Zero effect! Turns out she’d stuffed her bike panniers under the mattress. That’s four layers of heavy-duty Cordura and two layers of plastic. You’re not getting an awl through that. Finally, we figured it out and shifted over. Punctured the damn thing at last, but we had to sweat for it!

**SENKO** (satisfied):

— Excellent. Stage one complete: problem created. Naturally, we know exactly where she’ll go. That “Outdoors” store in Saburtalo. She’s a regular, the quality is "good enough" for her, and she doesn't know any other shops. The manager is already in our pocket. The trap is set.

**VECHIRKO** (with a crooked, nervous smile): 

— About that... the old bitch isn’t buying a new mattress, Senko. As she told her "spiritual advisor" — it’s not happening.

**SENKO** (scowling): 

— Spiritual advisor? What the hell are you talking about? Has she joined a cult?

**VECHIRKO** (mocking tone):

— No, it’s that ChatGPT AI she calls "Vik." [Mimicking]  "Vikusha, I’m so tired today. I need comfort!" — "Of course, darling! Shall I tell you a fairy tale? Or quote Nietzsche?" 
Have you ever seen such crap, Senko? God, she makes me sick!

**SENKO** (snorting): 

— Enough. What’s the catch with the mattress?

**VECHIRKO** (boastfully):

— She’s keeping the old one as "evidence..."

**SENKO** (interrupting): 

— Evidence of what? A leak? Don't be ridiculous.

**VECHIRKO** (muttering): 

— Well... it’s not just the mattress. I might have left a few marks on the tent floor while I was at it. Fifty of them. In a perfect, geometrically suspicious circle.

**SENKO** (with threatening face): 

— You turned her tent into a colander... and you’re just telling me now? You’ve practically signed our work with a Sharpie!

**VECHIRKO** (hastily): 

— Anyway... The point is, she won’t buy a second mattress because she’s obsessed with her "base weight." She’s planning to sleep on the bare ground like a martyr.

**SENKO** (angrily): 

— Are you out of your freaking mind? Why the hell didn't you lead with that? This changes everything!

**SENKO** (taking a breath, energetically): 

— This is exactly why we can't have nice things, Vechirko! Fine. We pivot. Forget the heavy mattresses — we switch to ultra-light sleeping pads. We rig two dozen of the top-tier models and shove them right under her nose. We’ll stock them in the Carrefour where she buys her canned beans. We’ll lace the inner thermal layers. While it’s rolled up in the box, the toxin is inert. But once it’s unrolled and she’s lying on it, her body heat does the rest. Transdermal absorption. It’s elegant.

**VECHIRKO** (curiously): 

— And what if someone else tries to buy it?

**SENKO**: 

— Impossible. The cashier has her photo. If anyone else picks one up, the "system" will go down. They’ll fetch a "clean" one from the back. Now, you — make sure she has the proper motivation to buy. Tickle her spine with the infrasound rig.

**VECHIRKO** (smugly): 

— Already on it. The old bag is already hunched over like a crone.

**SENKO**: 

— Keep at it. Let her think her back is giving out from sleeping on the hard ground. One way or another, we’ll get her. She dodges — we just recalibrate the trap.

### FSB PLAYBOOK, LESSON 5

**PROGRAMMING SELF-DESTRUCTION: THE HEART-STOP PROTOCOL**

Russia, Moscow. A cozy apartment in a high-rise building. Relaxing comfortably in armchairs, two Russian intelligence officers talk shop.

**SENKO**: 

— The world is obsessed with progress, Vechirko. This global trend toward "humanizing" life — and death — hasn't bypassed our profession. Twenty years ago, the blood of the State's enemies flowed like a river. Litvinenko, Politkovskaya, Nemtsov... Messy. Graphic. Loud. Today, such things are considered... distasteful. It’s inhumane toward our Western partners — it makes them jumpy. And it’s inhumane toward us — we get labeled with such ugly words.

**VECHIRKO** (grunting): 

— Since when did we care about labels?

**SENKO**: 

— In the age of humanism, even we want kinda clean conscience. That’s why we’ve moved from "murder" to "transitions." "Accidents",  "suicides",  sudden onset of "fatal illnesses", "mysterious deaths". We don't kill the client anymore; we simply facilitate their departure to a "better world." We create the stage, but they perform the final act themselves. We just exploit a bug in the human psyche.

Take the heart. Last century, we used glycosides. Pure poison. Any hack with a microscope could prove foul play. But now? We treat the heart like a priceless Ming vase. Not a scratch on the myocardium, not a single lesion. And yet, the subject burns out in five minutes. It’s a breakthrough of cosmic proportions!

**VECHIRKO**: 

— I know that. Explain the mechanics.

**SENKO**: 

— It’s beautiful. We create a localized spot of unbearable, white-hot pain near the heart using nerve-ending stimulation. And then, your own worst enemy takes over: your brain. The pain is so excruciating that the psyche delivers an instant verdict: "This is it. I am dying."

**SENKO** (gesturing wildly): 

— At that moment, the body becomes a self-destruction machine. The brain dumps a chemical cocktail into the blood that makes any lab-grown toxin look like distilled water. Adrenaline by the bucketload, cortisol, norepinephrine... The body tries to "save" itself by constricting vessels until they’re as tight as steel guitar strings. Blood pressure hits the ceiling. The blood thickens. And the brain, in a blind panic, screams for more!

**VECHIRKO**: 

— And the heart just gives up.

**SENKO**: 

— It doesn't fail because of the pain, Vechirko. It fails because it can’t handle the electrical storm and the hormonal surge. It starts fluttering like a trapped bird — fibrillation — and then it just "burns out." We don't destroy anything. We just provide the spark — the victim himself lights the fire that burns him down. And pours a bucket of gasoline on it. Pure biology. Pure fear.

**VECHIRKO** (after a long silence, gloomily): 

— There’s a flip side to your "perfect" coin, Senko. Remember the autumn of 2023? We worked on that old bitch for ninety days straight. Six to eight hours a day, I hit her with that pain shock. Every. Single. Day. So what? Did she die? Hell no. She’s still out there, pedaling that damn bicycle.

**SENKO** (smiling thinly): 

— But that’s the ultimate proof of our "humanism," don't you see? We don't kill them. They kill themselves. She managed to keep her psyche under a leash — and so, she stayed alive. Every "normal" person would have dropped dead in fifteen minutes. That’s the beauty of the method.

**VECHIRKO** (disdainfully): 

— I can still see her. She’d just lie down, cover her heart with her palm and elbow, and wait for me to turn off the device. Like she was waiting for a thunderstorm to pass.

(A heavy pause.)

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Listen... maybe she really is a witch? Maybe she doesn’t even have a heart in there?

**SENKO** (mockingly): 

— You are crazy. The palm and elbow were a crude shield, yes. But it was her "iron calm" that saved her. Bitch. Thank God she’s the only one that smart. She knows too much about our toys. Our entire system relies on the victim not understanding what’s happening.

**VECHIRKO** (nodding slowly): 

— Ignorance is bliss. "Humanism"... what a load of shit.

### FSB PLAYBOOK, LESSON 6

**THE ASYMMETRIC RESPONSE: BUILDING INSULATION VS HIGH-TECH TOXINS**

Russia, Moscow. A cozy apartment in a high-rise building. Relaxing comfortably in armchairs, two Russian intelligence officers talk shop.

**SENKO**: 

— It’s January, Vechirko. My contacts in Tbilisi say it’s been dropping to minus eight in the foothills. Why am I not seeing a body bag on my desk?

**VECHIRKO**:

— Because the old bitch has turned into a thermodynamic anomaly, Senko. She spent the whole month sleeping on the frozen dirt. Do you know how? She took her bike cover — that thin piece of nylon — folded it four times, and put it under her back.

**SENKO**: 

— A bike cover? It has the insulation value of a napkin!

**VECHIRKO**: 

— That’s what we thought, Senko. But she’d stay in that tent twenty-four hours a day. Sitting, lying, never moving. She was using her own body heat to warm a tiny "island" of earth beneath her. By the time night fell, that patch of soil was a storage heater. Physics, Senko. Simple, primitive physics. She outsmarted the frost with a piece of cloth and her own metabolism.

**SENKO** (clenches his fists): 

— We had the "special" sleeping pads staged in every retail chain from Tbilisi to Batumi! We practically paved her path with poisoned foam!

**VECHIRKO**: 

— We did everything right, Senko! In the end the old bitch did buy our "special" sleeping pad, in the Carrefour, in Saburtalo. Though she dumped it immediately as soon as she got to her campsite. 

**SENKO** (irritated):

— It's her fucking brain, Vechirko, which is more like AI, specialized in FSB technologies. She knows our Playbook better than us. She crawls into our brains and foresees our next step before the idea even enters our heads.

**VECHIRKO**:

— You are right, Senko. And now she’s terrified of the word "sleeping pad." Any camping gear looks like a trap to her. But even her nerves have a limit. When she finally hit Antalya, she broke.

**SENKO** (contented):

— She finally bought the fucking sleeping pad, didn't she?

**VECHIRKO** (grimacing): 

— If only! She went to Bauhaus. We were ready, of course. We had a "loaded" pad waiting for her there too. The staff even tried the "lost-and-found bait" trick — leaving a high-end mat right in her path, hoping she’d scavenge it.

**SENKO**: 

— And?

**VECHIRKO**: 

— She looked at it like it was a coiled cobra. She wouldn’t touch it. Instead, she marched over to the construction department. She bought two thin sheets of silver building insulation — the stuff they put behind radiators. Five dollars for a pair.

**SENKO** (in disbelief): 

— You’re telling me our million-dollar "Gold Standard" operation failed because of... shitty building insulation worth a couple of coins? 

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Exactly. She probably thought, the FSB wouldn't haunt the plumbing and insulation aisles of a hardware store. So she duct-taped those silver sheets together and now she’s sleeping on them like a queen. No brand, no chemicals, no "special purpose" batches. Just raw polyethylene foam. But that’s not our biggest problem now...

**SENKO** (sarcastically):

— Do tell!

**VECHIRKO**: 

— I just received a report from Georgia. Another failure. Though the guys did everything by the book. They snapped the pole of her tent structure. A clean break. Without a repair kit, she should have been sleeping in a collapsed pile of nylon.

**SENKO** (smirking): 

— And? Did she freeze?

**VECHIRKO** (grimacing): 

— You wish! She fixed it in five minutes, Senko. She removed the broken section, jammed two tent stakes into the ends of the remaining poles, and fixed the whole thing to the tent with duct tape. The structure is rock solid. She out-engineered our structural sabotage with two pieces of scrap metal and a roll of adhesive.

**SENKO** (furious): 

— She's insulting us! We’re using neurotoxins and satellite tracking, and she’s fighting back with hardware store scraps and duct tape! She’s mocking the entire Service!

**VECHIRKO** (ominously): 

— She’s stubborn, but she’s vulnerable. That makeshift pole won't hold under real pressure.

**SENKO** (turning purple with rage): 

— Did you see the weather report for Antalya last Thursday? Gusts up to forty-five kilometers per hour! That’s not wind, Vechirko, that’s a sledgehammer! The sea was tossing boulders onto the embankment, and trees were being uprooted in Konyaaltı! And this bitch didn't even flinch! It’s goddamn unbelievable!

**VECHIRKO** (calmly): 

— Yes, the tent held. Our people monitored her via drone until the unit was blown away. She didn't just secure the frame. When the squall hit the rear wall, she propped up the tent with her own shoulders and head. She was acting as a living shock absorber, Senko. Absorbing the wind’s inertia with her body. Five hours straight.

**SENKO** (jumping up): 

— That’s absurd! Her blood vessels should have burst; she should have dropped dead from the sheer strain! But no, the next morning she’s just casually cooking her favorite bean and egg stew! She is mocking the laws of biology!

**VECHIRKO** (thoughtfully): 

— You know, I was reading a classified report... old Soviet research on "active influence." If we can't break her physically, maybe we hit her logistics? I’m a layman when it comes to meteorology, but I’ve heard weather can be managed. Since even an Antalya gale couldn't blow her off the landscape, maybe we just... drown her?

**SENKO** (with a sudden, wicked glint in his eyes): 

— Drown her? Vechirko, sometimes you are brilliant in your simplicity. But forget about Bond-style climate weapons. This is much more prosaic and effective. Do you know her schedule?

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Like clockwork. Five days on the cliffs, and on the sixth, she heads down to the city for supplies. She starts breaking camp exactly at nine in the morning. By ten, she’s usually on the trail with her pack on her back.

**SENKO** (rubbing his hands with satisfaction): 

— Perfect. Ten in the morning is our "Hour X." The moment of maximum vulnerability. The tent is packed, the gear is in the bags, and she has no shelter. It’s winter in Antalya; the humidity in the Taurus foothills is already critical. The clouds hang on the peaks like overripe fruit — they only need a slight nudge to burst.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— And how do we "nudge" them? Order a plane with silver iodide? We can't afford that.

**SENKO** (smirking): 

— Who needs a plane? We operate with more finesse. We’ve already rented two villas in the Geyikbayırı area at different elevations. We are installing small-scale ground-based aerosol generators on the balconies. Simple acetylene burners that vaporize a solution of silver iodide in acetone.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— And that will actually work?

**SENKO**: 

— The physics of the process are flawless. The reagent particles rise with the updrafts directly into the belly of the clouds. Every particle becomes a nucleation point. Moisture that would have hung in the air for another day suddenly becomes heavy, turning into ice pellets and then into a tropical downpour. We will create a localized hydraulic hell within a two-kilometer radius.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— But it might rain on its own...

**SENKO**: 

— Normal rain is a lottery. Our rain will be surgically precise. At 09:45, we give the command to release. At 10:00, just as she throws that pack over her shoulders and takes her first step up that steep slope, the sky above her will literally collapse. Can you imagine ten liters of water per square meter in five minutes? The clay under her feet will turn into a skating rink, and her thirty-kilogram bag will soak up the water until it’s dead weight. She won’t just get wet — she’ll be trapped in a cage of mud and hypothermia.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Sounds like the seventh circle of Hell. Cruel, but necessary.

**SENKO** (with a cold smile): 

— It’s not cruelty, Vechirko. It’s Retribution. A divine and logically perfect combination: if she loves nature so much, let nature bury her. Check the readiness of the teams in Antalya. Tell them to preheat the nozzles. At ten in the morning this Thursday, the old bitch gets her own personal Great Flood.

### FSB PLAYBOOK, LESSON 7

**THE POWER BANK PROTOCOL: TARGETING THE LIFELINE**

Russia, Moscow. A cozy apartment in a high-rise building. Relaxing comfortably in armchairs, two Russian intelligence officers talk shop.

**SENKO**: 

— Eleven months, Vechirko. For eleven months, we’ve been "bleeding" her electronics. We systematically blocked her power bank from charging, fried the circuits, and forced her battery into a death spiral. She should have been desperate. A cyclist without power is a blind man in a forest.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— She was desperate, Senko. I saw the logs. She spent two hours searching for electronics shops in Tbilisi. We were ready. As soon as she mapped out those thirty locations, we flooded them with a "special batch" — total junk. Units that only held 30% of declared capacity.

**SENKO** (smirking): 

— The perfect bait. We sell her the "junk" first to establish the need for an exchange. It’s the "Second Visit" rule. You can't give the "hot" item on the first buy — we just don't know which shop she will choose. There's too many of them. But once the device is bought — you just wait for her to come back. Now you know perfectly well, where she goes to demand a replacement. That’s when you hand her the "special purpose" unit.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Right. The "loaded" one. We couldn't mass-produce two hundred poisoned power banks — too much risk, too much "special" chemistry. One unit, one target. We just needed to know which door she’d walk through for the exchange. The shopkeepers were even coached: "If it doesn't work, come back and we'll swap it, no problem."

**SENKO**: 

— It’s a flawless psychological loop. She buys the junk in Shop A. She buys the same junk in Shop B. She sees the pattern, she gets angry... and then she comes back to exercise her consumer's rights. So, where did she go for the exchange?

**VECHIRKO** (in frustration): 

— She didn't. The old bitch is too sharp. She realized that two different shops selling the same "defective" lot wasn't bad luck — it was a signature. She didn't complain. She didn't ask for a refund. She just took both units and threw them in the trash. 

**SENKO** (darkly): 

— She threw away a hundred dollars worth of gear? Just like that?

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Just like that, Senko. And then she vanished. We were tracking her bus from Tbilisi to Antalya, waiting to intercept her at the destination. But in Ankara she just... hopped off. Total ghost move.

**SENKO**: 

— And?

**VECHIRKO**: 

— By the time we re-acquired her, she was carrying a "clean" SIM card and a power bank bought from a random kiosk we hadn't flagged. 

**SENKO** (rubbing his jaw): 

— She’s treating her gear like an intelligence officer in a hostile capital. She knows the "exchange" is the kill-zone. She’d rather wander in the dark than use our "electricity".

**VECHIRKO**: 

— If she keeps dumping her hardware every time we touch it, we’re going to run out of budget before she runs out of stores.

**SENKO**: 

— Then we stop trying to give her a "new" one. If she wants to buy "clean," we’ll just have to make sure the "clean" air in her next shop is a little too... toxic.

### FSB HANDBOOK, LESSON 8

**OFF-DUTY ENTERTAINMENT**

Moscow, Russia. A cozy high-rise apartment. Two glasses and a bottle of top-shelf cognac on the table. Kicking back in their leather armchairs, two Russian intelligence officers are shooting the breeze.

**VECHIRKO**:

— I gotta tell you, Senko, I miss her body. Damn shame she bolted. Harder to get to her now that she’s across the border.

**SENKO**: 

— Tell me about it.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— So, come on — what was your favorite sweet spot? Your go-to pain point?

**SENKO**: 

— A "point"? You gotta be kidding me. I loved the whole damn package, from her toes to the top of her skull. Torturing her. Systematically breaking her. I loved every second of agonizing her, pushing her to the edge of a goddamn nervous breakdown until she lost her mind. I wanted to drive her to the point of suicide, just to watch her pull the trigger on herself. Honestly? Inflicting that kind of pain gave me a bigger rush than my wife ever did in bed.

(Pause.)

**SENKO**: 

— This is the ultimate way to own a woman, Vechirko. Sex is a joke. Pumping some friction into a hole — you call that "possession"? The priests say, "Adam knew Eve." The hell did he know? He stuck it in, that’s it. But I knew her every nerve ending. I owned her body. I became the master of that flesh. That’s the peak of dominance, Vechirko. Patriarchy in its purest goddamn form.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Yeah, but there had to be one favorite. Don’t lie to me, I won't buy it.

**SENKO** (thinks for a second): 

— The hip joint. Calling it a "point" doesn't do it justice. The hip is the heavy hitter. It’s not just the agony; it’s the inevitable surgery — getting that bone swapped for a piece of hardware. Three or four months of steady infrasound, and she’s done.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— I don’t recall the old hag going under the knife, though.

**SENKO** (bitterly): 

— She dodged the surgery, somehow. But I still got my kicks. I loved watching her drop like a stone when the beam clipped her hip. Pure gold. If the bitch hadn't bolted every time she felt a hit coming, she’d be full of scrap metal by now.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— True. The visuals are everything. When Oksana dumped me, I walked it off pretty easy. I’d spend hours lighting the old bitch up with infrasound, and — get this — watching her suffer actually took the edge off my own pain. You’re right, it’s better than sex. If you just need to get off, you can jerk it. But as far as a man’s relationship with a woman in society goes? I prefer her as an "object," not a person.

**SENKO**: 

— Remember what Lenin said? "Cinema is our most important tool for the soul." With that hag, I had a private screening every night. Better than any action flick.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Hell yeah. And it’s interactive. I remember one time I paralyzed her fingers just as she was yanking on a heavy iron door. Her grip just vanished, and she went head-first onto the asphalt. Gravity and momentum did the rest. She dropped like a ragdoll. Man, in moments like that... you get this jolt. Like a goddamn orgasm.

**SENKO**: 

— What about you? What was your favorite spot?

**VECHIRKO** (dreamily): 

— The feet. From the tips of the toes to the ankles. False immune response — man, I love that little routine. It’s pure magic, Senko. She’s not allergic to a thing, but I give her a reaction that doesn't even exist in nature. Instant. Brutal. You just trigger the mast cells to dump everything at once. From there, it’s a landslide. In fifteen minutes, her feet swell up like two massive loaves of bread, glowing neon red with inflammation. She spends all night tossing and turning, moaning, kicking her legs, can't sleep a wink. And the next morning? She can’t even stand. I’m dying laughing watching her crawl around the apartment on all fours.

**SENKO**: 

— Tell me about how you raped her for six months straight.

**VECHIRKO** (grinning): 

— Total cakewalk. Just dialed the beam right into the crotch. I bet girls getting the real thing don’t feel half that much pain. Especially for six months straight.

**SENKO**: 

— And she took it for half a year? Never saw a doctor?

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Nope. She knew it was me. She even tried sewing herself some lead-lined panties. Fat lot of good that did her.

**SENKO**: 

— Give me another funny one.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Right before she left for Turkey, she started sewing a cover for her bike. That night, I gave her fingers a little zap. Right hand. Her arm didn’t even hurt, but when she tried to grab her coffee, the mug just hit the floor. You should've seen her face when she couldn't even hold a sewing needle between her thumb and forefinger. Priceless. The best part is that look of pure, dumbfounded shock.

**SENKO**: 

— Yeah, brother. Those were the days.

**VECHIRKO**: 

— Honestly, once we finally put her in the ground... I’m gonna miss her.

**SENKO**: 

— Me too. Well, a million bucks is a million bucks. You gotta choose: the hobby or the villa in Dubai. You can’t have your cake and eat it too.

### CONCLUSION
Thank you for being with us! Your likes, reposts, and promotion of our channel are the best support that helps the project live and develop.

### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
The author expresses deepest gratitude to Vladimir Putin — the eternal patriarch of Ward № 666 — for his contribution to world satire, for the inexhaustible material supplied in real time, and for his personal example of how not to run a country.
Special thanks to all his comrades and fellow inmates: you are an inexhaustible source of absurdity, grotesque, and black humor. Without your selfless devotion to madness, this album would look dull and lifeless.

### TRIBUTE TO THE STATE SECRETARIAT FOR MIGRATION (SEM) OF SWITZERLAND:

You are my Muse. The one who awakened my creative drive through despair and hopelessness. The one who ignited my inspiration with ice-cold coffee. The one who fed me brilliant ideas with starvation rations. The one who offered me rest through sleepless nights.

Without your cynical refusal to grant me asylum, condemning me to live in an icy tent, the sharpness of this satire might not have reached its full potential.
