TRIBUTE TO THE STATE SECRETARIAT FOR MIGRATION (SEM) OF SWITZERLAND:

You are my Muse. The one who awakened my creative drive through despair and hopelessness. The one who ignited my inspiration with ice-cold coffee. The one who fed me brilliant ideas with starvation rations. The one who offered me rest through sleepless nights.

Without your cynical refusal to grant me asylum, condemning me to live in an icy tent, the sharpness of this satire might not have reached its full potential.

### INTRODUCTION
What lies before you is not just a collection of caricatures. It is an anatomical cross-section of the Putin era: Orthodox military Putinism as a form of collective madness.
Here you will find icons with pagan gods, baptisms in trenches, holy water — administered intramuscularly. Here patriotism comes with a sock on the genitals, and the Pentagon’s combat dolphins swim freely.
In these miniatures, society appears as one where war has replaced common sense, “traditional values” have replaced conscience, and Orthodoxy has become the “lubricant” for missile launchers. Priests bless violence, deputies trade in patriotism, and schools teach not to think, but to give birth and obey.

## ZERO-1. NOBEL CAPERS

American bar.
Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump at table, drinking beer.

**Trump**:

— Vova, after you took care of Navalny, your political scene is a total cakewalk. Smooth sailing. God's in his heaven, all's right with the world.

**Putin**:

— Don't be naive. Navalny was a nobody. All talk, no action. A glorified blogger.

**Trump**:

— Then why'd you have to wipe his whole organization off the map? For a nobody?

**Putin**:

— Donny, use your head. The man had no platform. Just a bunch of kids in the streets chanting curses at me. Is that a policy? Look at Lenin — now *that* was an agenda: factories for the workers, land for the peasants. This clown? Just insults. It's... tasteless.

**Trump**:

— Yeah, stupid. A real amateur.

**Putin**:

— Precisely. In my entire career, only one man ever truly worried me — Boris Nemtsov. A real politician. Knew what he was doing.

**Trump**:

— So you had him whacked so he wouldn't run?

**Putin** (scoffs):

—  No. We wouldn't have let him run anyway — the election commission would've seen to that. And for the record, I didn't give that order.

**Trump**:

— But come on, Vova. Everyone knows it was your security guys.

**Putin**:

— We don't do messy public spectacles anymore. That's last century's playbook. Why the drama and the headlines when you can make anyone... disappear? Quietly. Neatly. Anyone. Even a U.S. President.

**Trump** (shifting uncomfortably):

— Whoa, Vova, that's not my war! That's all on Biden. And you know I'm your friend. You know that.

**Putin** (in a mocking tone):

— I know. I see you twisting in the wind, playing both sides.

**Trump** (defensively):

— Vova, I swear on my life, I got nothing against you personally. Hell, I even get where you're coming from. I just... I want that Nobel!

**Putin** (musing aloud):

— A perfectly understandable ambition. I've been thinking... why shouldn't I have one? Next year, perhaps.

**Trump** (eyes popping):

— You?!

**Putin** (condescendingly):

—  Donny, everyone has a price. Some are just cheaper than others. And if that doesn't work... well, there are other levers. Threats, kompromat, blackmail... The machine is very, very efficient.

(A heavy pause hangs in the air)

**Putin** (with an ironic smile):

— You know, a Nobel would look even better on my chest than on yours. Just think of the headline: "War Criminal Putin, Nobel Laureate." That is the ultimate  proof of my power over the world. It's even cooler than my army at the gates of Paris! That's how you bend this cowardly Europe over and fuck it good and proper!

**Trump** (nervously):

— Hey, Vova, how about... I get the Nobel first, then you can do whatever you want with this cowardly Europe. Deal?

**Putin** (waves a dismissive hand):

— Fine. You first, Donny. Besides, I've got to get to Kyiv before I start collecting prizes...

## ZERO-2. DOCTOR AIBOLIT. VERSION 2.0

![](Images/En_Album_002.jpg)

Beneath a tree, so firm and fit,

Sits kindly Doctor Aibolit.

To clerk and cadet, he calls, "Come near,

I'll mend your wounds and banish fear,"

Says kindly Doctor Aibolit.


Then Musa comes, a limping sight,

"A wasp has stung me in a fight!"

Then Portos groans, "I'll tell you what,

A drone has blown my nose right off!"


A girl runs up, her cries are wild,

"My Vasya, oh my precious child!

He trod a path of mine-laid death,

And blew his legs from underneath!

My poor, lame son, in throbbing pain,

He writhes and whimpers once again!"


But Aibolit says, "Have no dread,

Just bring your boy up to my bed!

I'll stitch new legs, strong and complete,

For marching down that mined-up street!"


So in they carried Vasya, pale,

A broken form, a tragic tale.

The doctor sewed with skill and art,

New limbs to play a deadly part.

His girl now dances, spins with glee,

And shouts, "A miracle to see!

Thank you, good Doctor, for your care!"


But hark!—hoofbeats fill the air,

From the east, a rider, Aksakal.

"An urgent note!" he gives the call.

"I cannot stay, I must be quick!"

And then he leaves with cunning trick.


"It calls you forth to Zhmerynka, go!

Our brothers die, their time runs low!"

"Are they wounded?" asks the saint.

"Yes, and covered in filth and taint."

"They burn with fever, drown in tears,

Their bowels clogged with hopeless fears.

If you won't come to make them whole,

We'll dump them in a swampy hole!


For Putin gave his firm command:

On to the Caucasus, make your stand!"

The sun, the sea, the peaks so grand,

"Russian World" needs a saving hand!


That "Russian World", now vast and eternal—

Mud, swamps, and sands in a cycle infernal,

Where the green men's bootprints, deep and profound,

Are stomped into that consecrated ground.

## ZERO-3. PUTIN IN THE HALL OF TWO TRUTHS: JUDGMENT OF OSIRIS

![](Images/En_Album_003.jpg)

> Sacred ancient Egyptian temple. Inside, well-known procedure of Judgment of the Egyptian god Osiris, as described in the "Book of the Dead," is taking place. Also participate:
> 
> • God Thoth (court secretary, clay tablet in  hands)
>
> • God Anubis (forensic expert)
>
> • Goddess Maat (prosecutor)
>
> • 42 Egyptian God-jurors (wearing masks of Hitler, Mussolini, Lenin, Stalin, Beria, Brezhnev, Zhirinovsky, Dracula, the Devil, and other historical figures)
>
> • Russian president, Vladimir Putin (defendant)
>
> Hall illuminated by TV screens broadcasting court proceedings. Putin stands by gigantic apothecary scales; on one scale pan lies a red paper heart with a gilded engraving: "Putin: 86%". The other pan is empty, yet the scales balance each other.

**Osiris**:

— We begin the live broadcast of the most fair trial in the history of the universe! Today, on the Scales of Truth — the fate of the Great Guardian of Traditional Values! But first — a word from our sponsor. Presenting: the elixir of youth "Ambre"!

(Commercial break: the goddess Hathor drinks the potion and instantly becomes 3000 years younger. Voiceover: "Ambre: a sip leading to Eternity.")

**Osiris** (addressing Putin):

— Do you trust this court? Any objections to the judges?

**Putin** (with a slight smile):

— Oh, Your Honor! How could I! The history of Russian-Egyptian relations... We have repeatedly provided aid... Forgiven debts... Built power plants... The Aswan Dam... Complete mutual understanding...

**Osiris**:

— Of course. We remember. The court will now retire to the deliberation room.

(Everyone remains seated, as they were.)

**Maat**:

— I object! You are violating procedure! The defendant has not yet recited the 42 declarations of innocence before the jurors: I have not killed, not stolen, not lied, not falsified weights and measures... and so on.

**Osiris** (reluctantly):

— Hmm... Very well. Defendant, tell us your autobiography.

**Putin**:

— Gladly, Your Honor.
I was born an ordinary Petersburg kid — an average C student. And through my own persistent labor, reaping the rewards in the field of state service, I climbed to the pinnacle of power — became president of a great country. I pursued the most humane and just policies. In my decrees, I promised every citizen a separate apartment, free healthcare and education, high wages, and zero inflation. I established lasting peace in the warlike Chechen Republic. I became the world's most generous donor. I built 20 oil and gas pipelines. My gas lights and heats the entire planet. I aid national liberation movements worldwide — supplying them with weapons at discounted prices. I distribute billion-dollar loans to poor countries and annul their debts a couple of years later. I give China my natural resources for a pittance. Thanks to my policies, the NATO bloc has significantly expanded its borders. I liberated the fraternal Ukrainian people from the tyranny of Zelensky's fascist regime. I stopped the bloody slaughter in Ukraine.

(An ad pops up on the screen: "Gas for every tomb! Let life never end!")

**Putin** (looks at the screen for a second, then continues with his statement):

— I launched the first man into space. My court composer wrote the immortal masterpiece "Swan Lake" [performs a few ballet steps to Tchaikovsky's music]. Finally, I rid the world of Hitler and his fascist dictatorship.
I toiled like a slave on a galley in the post of President for 50 years! I served a life sentence!
I lifted my country from its knees. I sold the factories to the workers and the land to the peasants. I created the world's number one army.
I extended a helping hand and protected Russian-speaking compatriots abroad from arbitrary treatment: in the Baltics, Central Asia, and the Caucasus. We safeguard the rights and freedoms of Russian diasporas across the entire former USSR.
Life expectancy in the country increased dramatically: I lived to be 98 years old.
Medicine is developing at a rapid pace: I died not from illness, but from boredom.
The patriotism of the younger generation is off the charts: my portrait hangs in every school classroom. Traditional values are taking root deep. We only have two-sex marriages. Divorces, abortions, condoms —  banned. Lesbians and gays — stripped of citizenship. Opponents and critics of the government — all in prison. On Earth, peace; among men — complete loyalty. Is this not an idyll? I have established an eternal celebration of life in my country.

**Osiris** (smiling broadly):

— Enough. You are the quintessence of virtue. The court will now retire to the deliberation room.

(Everyone remains seated.)

**Maat** (angrily):

— Wait! You are violating procedure again... The prosecution has not yet had its say!

**Osiris**:

— Dear Maat, all in due time. A time to gather stones, a time to listen to fables. When it's time for your fantasies [suddenly shouting], I will tell you! The court will now retire to the deliberation room!

(Everyone remains seated.)

**Osiris** (after a pause):

— Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, please vote...

**Maat** (jumping up, brandishing her feathers):

— I object! The prosecution's case has not been heard! The weighing of the heart has not been conducted!

**Osiris** (sternly):

— Dear Maat, the defendant's heart was weighed in a special procedure. It has been found lighter than your feather. For it is as pure as the tear of an unborn infant! Anubis!

**Anubis** (producing a pre-prepared protocol from under his robe):

— The scales show zero point zero grams. Innocence is total and absolute.

(The scale pans suddenly begin to oscillate up and down spontaneously. Anubis grabs the pans, trying to balance them.)

**Osiris** (unperturbed):

— It's nothing: perturbations on the Sun. The mechanism appears to be... weather-dependent.

**Putin** (staring into the emptiness above the gods' heads):

— The machinations of Western partners led by NATO. They've even reached the Afterlife. Again, they are encroaching on our spiritual bonds.

**Osiris** (banging his staff on the floor):

— So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, let's vote. Do you confirm the defendant's complete innocence?

**Jurors** (in unison):

— Yes!

**Zhirinovsky**:

— Clone him!

**Brezhnev**:

— Decorate him with an award!

**The Devil**:

— Canonize him!

**Stalin**:

— We are of the same blood!

**Beria**:

— I bow to you, Teacher!

**Mussolini**:

— Pleased to meet you, colleague!

**Dracula**:

— You know how to suck. Our kind of guy!

**Osiris** (ignoring Maat's protests):

— The court announces the verdict:
The defendant is acquitted.

**Maat** (waving a thick stack of photos in the air):

— Are you out of your minds? Here is the evidence! Murders! Abductions! Poisonings! Wars! Hybrid attacks! Falsifications!

(The evidence appears on the screen but almost instantly vanishes. The screen is covered with fine static. A minute later, an image of Putin against the backdrop of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior appears, immediately replaced by the cartoon "Dunno on the Moon".)

**Osiris** (smiling):

— Esteemed gods! Let's vote! All in favor of immortality, glory, and apotheosis for the defendant?

(All 42 gods raise their hands in unison. A commercial is broadcast: "The new 'Pharaoh-Deluxe' sarcophagus! Three colors: black granite, white marble, George ribbon.")

**Thoth** (reading from the clay tablet):

— Approved unanimously! Death is revoked, eternal life is granted! The name "Vladimir Putin" shall be inscribed on the title page of the "Book of the Dead" in golden ink!

**Putin** (nodding):

— I thank you. This is our shared victory. A special thanks to my faithful dog, Anubis. He's a good boy.

(Anubis wags his tail, embarrassed.)

**Maat** (in despair, dropping her feathers on the floor):

— Inconceivable! Unbelievable! I am filing an appeal with the Martian Intergalactic Court!

(She is dragged away under the arms by attendants with bear heads. The broadcast cuts out. The screen shows dancing Cossacks.)

**Thoth** (closing the case folder):

— Thank you all, you are free to go. The session is closed.

> **Culturological Commentary**
>
> The miniature is based on the ancient Egyptian myth of the Judgment of Osiris. According to the "Book of the Dead," the soul of the deceased was brought into the Hall of Two Truths, where it faced:
>
> — Osiris — god of the underworld, presiding judge.
>
> — Maat — goddess of truth and justice, the standard of purity.
>
> — Anubis — jackal-headed god who conducted the weighing of the heart.
>
> — Thoth — god of wisdom, court scribe.
>
> — 42 God-jurors — each responsible for one specific sin; the deceased had to swear before each god that he had not committed that sin.
>
> The main procedure — the weighing of the heart: the heart of the deceased was placed on one scale pan, and the feather of Maat on the other. If the heart was "lighter than the feather," the soul was deemed pure and granted eternal life; if heavier, it faced annihilation. This ritual symbolized absolute justice and the impossibility of deception.

**Judge:**

— I see not the slightest grounds. The crime is obvious, though incomplete: first a cup, then a stone. A clear act of visual incitement to terrorism — a public demonstration of terrorist methods. Sentence upheld!

• the beaches of Mariupol (paid for with our blood!),

We will fight these scoundrels. We are passing a law on preventive confiscation:

• Apartments — for seditious appeals,

• Dachas — for slanderous fabrications,

• Bank accounts — for unpatriotic fantasies.

— The fishing here is excellent... Since time immemorial... Our river, Old Rus’… Mother Volga and Father Dnieper — all the waters of Rus’ came from them… As the great Russian poet once said: “The Dnieper is wondrous in calm weather...”

**Putin:**

— Indeed. By the way, a thousand years ago, right on this very spot, Prince Vladimir caught a giant Perch weighing over 100 pounds! It’s recorded in The Tale of Bygone Years!

(Putin awakens: drizzle, a nasty gray fog drifting over the Moscow River. He dials Medinsky.)

Then you pump your gospel everywhere. Schools, TV, TikTok. “Make America Great Again” — tattoo it on every wall if you have to.

I’d brand the whole damn country:

Slap your name on everything — Americans love that crap.

Two parties? Forget it. Dems, Republicans — same circus, different clowns, just swap costumes every four years.
Start your own party: TrumParty. Big, loud, orange.

Hell, make your slogan bigger: MAGA — PTAGA.
“Make America Great Again: Prosperity To All. God. Hallelujah!”

**Trump**:

— PTAGA! Vova, that’s killer. I love it.

**Putin**:

— See? It works.
And when they get bored — declare war on Canada.
Dig up some lost Native American empire. Chingachgook the Great Snake — Ruler of All America.

Boom — you’ve got history, you’ve got borders, you’ve got war.
New state, new elections, new terms.

**Trump**:

— Dude, this is gold. You’re a genius, Vova.

**Putin**:

— Exactly. You take half the globe, I take the other half.
You’ll be Lord of Meridians, I’ll be Lord of Parallels.
Two kings, one planet. Cheers, Donnie.

## 52. PUTIN'S SNOW JOB: BLOW-BY-BLOW GUIDE-LIE TO DIE FOR

![](Images/En_Album_52.jpg)

American bar. Russian President Vladimir Putin and US President Donald Trump at table, drinking beer.

**Trump**:

— Vova, tell me straight: why’d you kill Navalny? Was he really that dangerous to you?

**Putin**:

— Donnie, you’re killing me here!
His numbers were below zero. Why on earth would I fear a guy like that?

**Trump**:

— Then I don’t get it…

**Putin**:

— You have to get it, Donnie.
He bugged me. Drove me nuts. Just hearing his name made my blood pressure spike.
I couldn’t stand living in the same country, breathing the same air.
I gave him the chance to leave — he came back. Why?

**Trump**:

— And then you had him killed?

**Putin**:

— Donnie, don’t be so crude.
I only locked him up.
For financial crimes.
A thief belongs in jail, Donnie. Am I right?

**Trump**:

— Then why did he die?

**Putin**:

— Fifteen chronic illnesses, Donnie. Even herpes. With a list like that, nobody lasts long.

**Trump**:

— That many? But he was still young!

**Putin**:

— That’s what my guys told me, Donnie.
Twenty conditions. Including prostatitis. Same people who worked the Magnitsky case — pros, real pros. My A-team.

**Trump**:

— Never heard of it. Not even Fox told me! Unbelievable!

**Putin**:

— We didn’t know either. But after the autopsy — boom! Twenty-five diseases. Even sciatica. Like some old wreck.

**Trump**:

— Incredible, just incredible. He looked like a healthy guy!

**Putin**:

— Donnie, if you don’t believe me, I’ve got the papers. Certificates, medical files, autopsy reports… all clean. Thirty conditions, Donnie. Including gallstones. He was rotten to the core.

**Trump**:

— Then how the hell did he even last three years in prison?

**Putin**:

— He had nine lives, Donnie. Like a cat. Not even “Novichok” could finish him off. Tough specimen.
Picture it — thirty-five chronic illnesses. Plus lice!
That wasn’t a man, that was a walking corpse!

**Trump**:

— Then why won’t you give the widow his stuff — documents, tapes ? If everything’s so clean?

**Putin**:

— Donnie, my guys are worried it’ll end up in German hands again. And you know how the Germans are — they can pull "evidence" out of thin air. We don’t need another "Novichok" fiasco.

**Trump**:

— And why do you keep changing the story? The cause of death? First it was arrhythmia, now it's poisoning?

**Putin**:

— Local screw-up. Some investigator out in Yamal. Wrote nonsense, couldn’t read between the lines.

(Pause):

**Putin**:

— It was clearly a tragic death caused by a rare cold-related allergy. Entirely natural, nothing suspicious at all.

**Trump** (aside, smirking):

— FSB's Tablets? Commandment #1: Deny the obvious.

(Pause)

**Trump** (to Putin, cheerful):

— Anyway, enough of this sad stuff. Let’s grab a beer for a cheer.

**Putin**:

— To us!

— What?! The Messiah?! Yesterday he thought he was Hitler!

**Third Professor**:

— Today he has a new mission: “Saving the Ukrainian brotherly people.”

**First Professor**:

— And how does he plan to pull that off?

**Second Professor**:

— As usual: bombings, killings, kidnappings.

**Third Professor**:

— Paranoid geopolitical delusions with a messiah complex…

**First Professor**:

— Pure lunacy, nothing more.

**Second Professor**:

— Colleagues, let’s avoid lyricism. A specific personality disorder.

**Third Professor**:

— The patient cries, saying: “Ukraine is our pain and tragedy.”

**First Professor**:

— And keeps droning on about some “root causes of the conflict” that “must be eliminated.”

**Second Professor**:

— And every five minutes hysterically shouts: “I want all of Donbas!”

**Third Professor**:

— Otherwise — cheerful, vigorous, active, recently met with this... character… in the red cap…

**First Professor**:

— Ah, the notorious “fireman,” the one who can stop wars with a single glance?

**Second Professor**:

— That’s him. A full 11 seconds shaking hands, then strolling down the red carpet, shamelessly flirting and winking.

**Third Professor**:

— Two of a kind, God forgive me! One raves about Donbas, the other about a Nobel Prize.

**First Professor**:

— Indeed, gentlemen. Vanity is a dangerous thing. It can end in a psycho-political disorder.

**Second Professor**:

— Colleagues! I think we clearly see a conflict of interests. Nothing good will come of this.

**Third Professor**:

— For Ukraine — absolutely.

**First Professor**:

— You’re right. Measures must be taken.

**Second Professor**:

— I suggest a drastic increase of haloperidol. Both oral and intramuscular.

**Third Professor**:

— It would also be advisable to prescribe calming baths of Ukrainian mud, accompanied by recordings of the "Crimea is ours!" shouts.

**First Professor**:

— And why not try electroshock therapy? Works wonders for specific disorders. The Ministry of Health already gave the green light.

**Second Professor** (solemnly):

— The Health Ministry  warns… Start acting like a brain-dead idiot, and you’ll get three thousand volts in the ass.

## 57. SHITTY IMMORTALITY

![](Images/En_Album_57.jpg)

Russia, Kremlin, President’s office. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mikhail Kovalchuk, his old friend, now overseeing life-extension research, at table.

**Putin** (almost affectionately):

– Well, Professor, report: how are things progressing with my immortality?

**Kovalchuk** (enthusiastically):

– There’s progress. Significant. We’re currently working on a project to preserve your... biological materials.

**Putin** (surprised):

– What? What does poop have to do with that?

**Kovalchuk** (hurriedly):

– Hold on. Don’t fuss. Hear me out first.

**Putin** (graciously):

– Speak.

**Kovalchuk**:

– Science has proven that freeze-drying excrement preserves intact DNA. We’ll freeze-dry and preserve your shit and pair it with a stack of photographs and a collection of your speeches. In the distant future, using your DNA and relying on your photos and samples of your public appearances, an exact replica of Vladimir Putin will be recreated. Probably 3D-printed. Well? What do you say?

**Putin** (pensively):

— Shitty immortality. A shitty idea. Say you print me out. But who am I? Nobody. Someone else will be sitting on the throne. They will immediately bring charges against me: the war, the arsons, the bombings, the cables, everything.

**Kovalchuk**:

— I don’t know about that. It’s impossible to predict what political system Russia will have by then.

**Putin** (with emphasis):

— That’s the point. I want a different kind of immortality. I want this — my present body — to serve me forever. Is that so hard?! Heart worn out — transplant. Liver, kidneys — transplant... It's as simple as that!

**Kovalchuk** (cautiously):

– But every organ has a service life – no more than eighty years...

**Putin**:

– Then take a heart from a schoolkid – a recent graduate. What, you feel sorry for some kid for my sake?

**Kovalchuk** (fervently):

– Not at all! I’d give you my own heart...

**Putin** (disgustedly):

– I don’t want yours. What the hell do I need your rusty junk for? Get me a young heart, with plenty of life left. And in 60 years, put in a new one. What’s so complicated?

**Kovalchuk**:

– At present, medicine can’t guarantee the organ will take. The probability of complications is quite high. So either wait another 20 years, or we preserve the shit.

**Putin** (grumpily):

– Fine, have it your way. Go on with your shit. But only as a backup. In the worst case, after my… death [his face distorted, as if in severe pain] it’ll go under the hammer for a million.

**Kovalchuk** (smiling):

– Yes. In the West, the shit of the powerful is highly valued. Some Italian artist, I think his name was Mandzoni, sold his poop for the price of gold. And now a 30-gram can of this shit costs hundreds of thousands of euros.

**Putin** (contemptuously):

– Well, if some lousy Italian shat gold ingots – my shit will go for ten million!

**Kovalchuk** (flatteringly):

– Maybe even more!

**Putin**:

– Only one condition: no greed! 30 grams?! That’s a laughingstock! What am I, a pigeon?

**Kovalchuk** (convincingly):

– You? No. You are a falcon. An eagle. A kite. A pterodactyl.

**Putin** (arrogantly):

– Exactly. And my shit must be of the highest quality. Refined. Deodorized. And make it blue. Blue blood – blue shit.

**Kovalchuk**:

– Of course, of course. First press. Virgin Putin shit. Or Putin virgin shit? Which is correct?

**Putin** (with hatred):

– Dismissed!

## 58. BLESSED ARE COPULATORS...

![](Images/En_Album_58.jpg)

Russia, Moscow, State Duma hall. 
Deputy Valentina Bebienko speaks from podium:

– Dear deputies! The President has set us the task of reviving great Russia tripling the birth rate. I won’t deny  it – the task is not easy. It's a difficult task. A super difficult one. But we are obliged to fulfill it. Because our president wants us to. I propose we approach the problem creatively. Of course, our target audience is young people. Under 30. After 30, influencing one's consciousness is not so easy. Mental patterns are already formed, and resistance to the state narrative is observed.

Now let's remember our own sad childhood. How did we satisfy our... needs – the perfectly legitimate urges of puberty? Secretly, stealthily, in dark stairwells on dirty windowsills, in damp basements, on dusty attics, or simply, God forgive me, in the park behind a bush. And always in tension: what if someone sees? What if the neighbors report us? And if, God forbid, you got caught – they drag you to the police, write a report, call your parents. In a word, shame for the rest of your life. 

This is wrong, comrades. This doesn't agree with the state demographic policy. Let's correct this imbalance. Let's give our children and grandchildren a happy childhood. Just as there used to be a phone booth on every corner – now in its place there will be a beautiful and tidy "reproduction pavilion". With surveillance cameras for facial recognition – we will award participants social bonuses on the "State Services" internet-portal. 
Inside – a spacious room with 4 double beds, a large TV on the wall. A film library with inspiring videotapes and soap operas. A cupboard with Viagra and accessories. Everything is high-style, clean, and attractive – from the cheerful wallpaper  to the playful patterns on the bed linen. 

And on the steps, instead of a doorman – a priest, sprinkling holy water on those entering, and with a blessing:
"Blessed are the copulators... in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit... in accordance with Presidential Decree No. 666..."

And after nine months, the system will automatically assess performance. If the birth of a child is confirmed, the parents will receive a one-time payment. In case of a male child, the amount will be doubled — in accordance with the state program for the militarization of demographic policy.

## 59. ONE HEAD FOR CROWN,  THE OTHER  RULES THE COUNTRY

![](Images/En_Album_59.jpg)

*Note: Illustration blocked by censorship.*

Spacious conference hall. Officials  seated inside. On illuminated stage well-known political leader lies on his back. His genitals fully exposed; his erect penis crowned with miniature, yet precise, copy of his own head. Small head of lying politician addresses audience with loud, pompous speech:

— The birth rate in the country is falling catastrophically. Like a stone dropped into an abyss. I've been long saying it and I repeat: condoms and abortions are to blame for everything! And LGBT. And Childfree. We must fight, fight, and fight against all this heresy. So far, we are doing poorly.

We banned abortions. So what? Now they go to China to have abortions. Or they give birth in Argentina and stay there for ever. Condoms are the utmost evil. Condoms are a personal insult to me. They violate the basic right of the individual — the right to procreate and multiply. Enshrined in the Constitution, by the way.

We banned condoms having named them  symbols of  extremism. So what? The black market for condoms is thriving. Underground manufactories of rubber goods are springing up like mushrooms after rain. All over the country. LGBT propaganda is oozing out of every crack. What is happening? This is a complete failure of my decrees implementation. I will not put up with this attitude.

If the state apparatus cannot force the population to give birth — I will force the state apparatus to give birth.

Turn on your brains, if any.
And start working.

Do we not have a sperm bank? Do we not have an egg bank?
Buy eggs from the population at a fixed price. Introduce a natural tax, for god's sake— one egg per month in favor of the state.

Engage the Academy of Sciences — let them create a state military Incubator. We will raise true patriots of our country. Who from their swaddling clothes will have memorized the military charter and the 10 commandments of Putinism. We will protect them from the pernicious influence of liberal parents. This will be the stronghold of our future prosperity and triumph.
Second. Engage the geneticists. The country does not need idle housewives and thinkers of any kind. The genes of future generations must be the right ones: patriotic, male, warlike.
Is it really so difficult? Get to work.

We will revive our great country and our great "second army of the world." Moreover, we will make it the first! Whatever the price.  Over the corpses of our enemies, through the tears of mothers, across the ravaged land — we will advance without fear and without mercy. We will crush any resistance and completely destroy anyone who dares to rise up against us. Even if it means bringing the entire country to its knees, we will do it. Make no mistake: the will of the state is iron, and nothing and no one can stop it.

(Stormy, prolonged applause.)

## 60. CULTURAL INFILTRATION OPERATION 

![](Images/Fr_Album_60.jpg)

Russia. Moscow. State Duma hall.
President of Russia Vladimir Putin is speaking to the deputies.

**Putin:**

— Esteemed deputies! Friends! Comrades!
The geopolitical situation has reached a boiling point. Russia’s enemies are not sitting idle. The West is doing everything in its power to destroy us. Especially Europe. Especially France. France has always been and remains our main adversary. France has constantly encroached on our traditional values, trying to destroy our cultural heritage and our language. Let us recall the 19th century, when, as a result of a French influence operation, the entire Russian elite spoke exclusively in French for decades. The Russian language found itself on the verge of complete oblivion and extinction. And if it weren’t for the deep Russian people, who quite rightly hated everything French, we would all now be speaking in French!

Yes, in the 19th century French intelligence failed, but now they are trying to take revenge.
Our enemies accuse us of allegedly waging a hybrid war against the West. Brazen lies! We are peaceful people. But the French truly do attack our culture, our traditional values, our language again and again. They have infiltrated the Russian language with a massive enemy landing force. Just look at how many French words we have — words so cleverly disguised that people don’t even suspect their speech is packed with French spy-words.

Chauffeur, tableau, theatre, chef-d’œuvre… There are thousands of them. It’s no longer clear whether it’s still Russian or already a dialect of French.
Well, the word “chauffeur” is nothing. But they're sneaking such destructive words as "president" and "revolution" into our language! This is nothing but blatant sabotage and an assault on our traditional values. What is this “president”? Russia has never had and never will have “presidents.” Only a tsar [pounds his chest]. Or take “revolution.” Revolutions and guillotines for royal families are purely French socio-political phenomena, absolutely alien to the Russian spirit. And by the way, we never had these abominations — until these shameful sabotage-words entered our language.

And this makes sense, comrades. Remember the Bible: “In the beginning was the Word.” And only after that — everything else. Meaning: there can be no revolution until the word “revolution” exists in the language. For example. In the Soviet Union there was no sex — this is a well-known fact. Why? Because there was no word “sex.” But once the opportunist Mikhail Gorbachev opened the borders to Western mass culture, the words “sex,” “gay,” “lesbian,” “LGBT” entered — and after that, debauchery and sodomy blossomed in Russia.

The conclusion, comrades: if we want to eradicate a phenomenon alien to our culture, we must erase from the language the very word that denotes it. Ban it by law, rewrite dictionaries, burn all books containing that word. All violators must be prosecuted.

And our so-called “linguists,” who shyly call these spy-words “borrowings”? This is sabotage, comrades, and we must stop it. First these sabotage-words assimilate, then they begin to multiply, and eventually they drive out the original Russian words. This is linguistic aggression, comrades. Linguistic genocide.
Justifying French borrowings in the Russian language must legally be equated to justifying terrorism. From five years to life imprisonment, depending on the particular word.

For neutral words (chauffeur, revanche, chef-d’œuvre, theatre) — five years.
For “revolution” (undermining the constitutional order) — ten years.
For “president” (discrediting the national leader) — fifteen years.

But the most insidious French sabotage-word is “condom.” We have seen with our own eyes how, after linguistic expansion, our market was literally flooded with these devilish rubber products. French ones, by the way. This unprecedented attack is aimed at the most valuable thing we have — our gene pool. This is a demographic atomic bomb, comrades. To destroy Russians even before they are born. This is the most blasphemous, the most sophisticated weapon of mass destruction.

The word “condom” must be erased from the Russian language. We must uproot it from our lives. The use of this word in any form is an act of high treason. In its highest manifestation. The depiction of a condom must be equated with displaying extremist symbols.

And in the future.
Comrades! We must strictly protect our language from the penetration of Western sabotage-words. This is the main defensive line in our struggle for traditional values.

Thank you for your attention!

## 61. GEOPOLITICAL SANDBOX
*Unfinished Mini-Play*

![](Images/All_Album_61.jpg)

Seven boys are playing in the Sandbox:
 Bully, Jew, and five others. Each boy is special, each wears a unique headpiece: a red cap, a white cap, a bucket hat, a peaked cap, a hat.
 

**ACT 1**

The Boys in the Sandbox

**HAT**:

— News, everyone! The Bully has started another fight.

**WHITE CAP:**

— With whom this time?

**HAT**:

— The Jew.

**WHITE CAP** (sternly):

— Bully, stop it immediately! Disrupting order in the Sandbox is unacceptable!

**BULLY**:

— And who are you to give me orders?

**WHITE CAP:**

— I am the Sandbox monitor. I am the moral authority.

**BULLY**:

— And I am the criminal Authority. I don’t care about your rules. I have a special path and special moral values.

**PEAKED CAP** (cautiously):

— And what's the fight about anyway? What are you arguing over?

**BULLY:**

— He grabbed my land!

**WHITE CAP:**

— Since when is it yours?

**BULLY**:

— It’s always been mine. My great-grandfather’s ashes are buried there!

**HAT**:

— But we agreed on the inviolability of borders! Your Uncle Boris put his signature on it!

**BULLY**:

— Boris was a fool and an alcoholic. Therefore, the deal is declared null and void! It’s my land. End of discussion.

(The Bully walks up to the Jew and punches him in the chest.)

**JEW**:

— Help! He’s killing me!

**HAT**:

— Hang in there, little guy! We’ll pass a Resolution right now. First. We fully condemn this aggression!

**BUCKET HAT:**

— Second. We recognize the Jew’s legitimate right to defend his territory by any means necessary.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— Third. We call on the Bully to respect the established order and immediately cease the conflict.

**WHITE CAP:**

— Should we maybe actually help him?

**BULLY** (making a scary face):

— Just you try! You’ll get a black eye!

**HAT**:

— Such statements are unacceptable! Personally, I find them concerning.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— And disconcerting.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— Guys, we need to be careful with him. Don’t forget: he has a bulldozer.

**BULLY**:

— Exactly! I’ll bring my bulldozer and smash this whole Sandbox to splinters!

(He hits the Jew again.)

**JEW** (in a whisper):

— He’s killing me.

**HAT**:

— My concern has multiplied many times over.

**PEAKED CAP**:

— My disconcertment is growing exponentially.

**WHITE CAP:**

— I heard that his so-called bulldozer is all rusted out and won’t start.

**BUCKET HAT** (with doubt in his voice):

— We don’t know for sure, what if he fixed it and installed new spark plugs?

**HAT**:

— We must be prudent. Let’s not anger him.

**BUCKET HAT**:

— But it’s obvious: as soon as he finishes off the Jew, he’ll attack the rest of us!

**PEAKED CAP:**

— I am, of course, a bit farther from him, and across the strait, but still, my knees are trembling with fear. Here’s an idea: let’s help the Jew, but just a little bit and secretly. That way the Bully won’t notice.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— The main thing is not to give too much. If the Bully starts losing ground, he’ll get angry. And then he’ll definitely bring his bulldozer and raze the entire Sandbox to the ground.

**HAT**:

— Correct. Let them fight. While the Bully is busy with this brawl, we can sleep soundly.

**WHITE CAP:**

— Excellent plan. We’ll do just that.


**ACT 2**

The New Monitor

A boy in a red cap, holding a golf club, approaches the Sandbox.

**RED CAP:**

— So, what do we have here? A complete mess. It’s all your fault, you foolish old man. Get out of the Sandbox! Your time is up. I’m the monitor now.

**WHITE CAP:**

— Fine. I’m leaving. I did all I could. Good luck with this conflict!

**RED CAP:**

— That’s not why I came. I came to get the Gold Peacemaker Medal. You, with your stupid decrees, only fueled this fight. I came to stop it. You’re a fool, and I’m smart. That’s the whole difference between us. Get out and stop bothering me.

(White Cap leaves.)

**JEW** (looking at the new monitor with hope):

— You will help me, right?

**RED CAP** (sternly):

— So many fine young men have fallen! Beautiful, splendid young men! And all because of you. Why did you let yourself be dragged into this conflict?

**JEW** (stunned):

— I let myself?! He was the one who started it!

**RED CAP**:

— And didn’t you see he’s a thousand times stronger than you? A normal person doesn’t pick a fight with a superior opponent. You should have negotiated right away, not escalated the conflict.

**JEW**:

— But I couldn’t just give him the land! My constitution doesn’t allow it.

**RED CAP**:

— Don’t give me that! You have no cards. You didn’t give it up then, you’ll give it up now. Don’t give it up now, you’ll give it up in a year. Same difference. Only another half a million fine boys will end up in the grave.

**JEW**:

— But that’s not fair! You should help me defeat him instead.

**RED CAP** (with condemnation):

— How much help did the old man give you? Billions in coins. You didn’t even say thank you. You just kept whining and begging for more. And then — where is it all? What happened to those billions?

**JEW**:

— I’m ashamed to admit it, but... they were a bit embezzled. It just happened. It’s not my fault!!!

**RED CAP:**

— You have to pay back all those billions to me. I heard significant deposits of rare-earth metals have been found on your plot? They belong to me now.

**JEW** (agitated):

— This is robbery!

**RED CAP**:

— You thought you’d get a free ride? That’s not how things are done. Sign here.

**JEW**:

— But I’m not authorized. I need parliamentary approval...

**RED CAP**:

— Oh, really?! Hey, Steve, call the guys — tell them to hold back our intel.

**JEW** (desperately):

— Not the intel! I beg you!

**RED CAP:**

— So, are you signing or not?

**JEW** (dejectedly):

— I’m signing.


**ACT 3**

The Same Characters

**RED CAP:**

— So, we begin the peace process. I demand an end to this fight. Bully, state your terms.

**BULLY**:

— He must give me two regions. Throw half of his toy soldiers in the trash. And renounce joining any military blocs.

**RED CAP:**

— Hmm... Not bad. Jew, do you agree?

**JEW** (firmly):

— Over my dead body.

**BULLY** (with a gloating smirk):

— That can be arranged.

**RED CAP:**

— Enough with your jokes! Jew, what’s the problem?

**JEW**:

— He wants me to give him the land without a fight. That’s absurd! There’s no precedent for that in military history.

**RED CAP:**

— Why do you need so much land? Half your population has emigrated.

**JEW**:

— I can’t. Society is against voluntarily ceding territory.

**RED CAP:**

— Hey, Steve! Hold back our intel!

**JEW** (hurriedly):

— Alright, alright. I agree, but I demand thorough detailing of the specifics.

**RED CAP:**

— What about the toy soldiers? And renouncing military blocs?

**JEW**:

— In that case, I need ironclad security guarantees — in case the Bully tries to take more of my land. Who will protect me? And how?

**RED CAP:**

— I’m giving you a personal guarantee: in case of renewed aggression, we’ll... figure something out. A 100% guarantee.


**ACT 4**

The Same Characters

**RED CAP:**

— I’m doing everything possible to reconcile these brawlers. I’ve tried every means. But the peace process is somehow stalled.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— You’re the best negotiator — strict but fair. Can I call you “Daddy”?

**HAT**:

— The perfect nickname! Daddy! We are in awe of your diplomatic skill! However, one can’t help but notice that you’re putting pressure on the Jew while fully supporting the Bully’s demands.

**BUCKET HAT:**

— Daddy! We would recommend putting pressure on the Bully as well — for example, you could give the Jew weapons. You promised! But for some reason, you aren’t...

**HAT**:

— It seems Daddy is afraid of the Bully’s bulldozer.

**RED CAP:**

— The bulldozer is a bluff. The Bully is pulling our leg. I’m not afraid of the bulldozer. What I am truly afraid of is that he’ll sneak up from behind, splash gasoline on my trousers, and set them on fire.

(Hat, Peaked Cap, and Bucket Hat exchange meaningful glances and giggle nervously.)

**RED CAP:**

— What’s so funny? Your trousers are just as vulnerable to him as mine are! So I advise you to think long and hard before giving weapons to the Jew. Personally, I wash my hands of it.

**PEAKED CAP:**

— Well, then you could impose secondary sanctions on the Bully.

**RED CAP:**

— Sanctions are a debatable matter. First, I don’t want to scare him away from the negotiations. Right now, the Bully is meeting me halfway, and we should value that. Second, he has the world’s largest reserves of rare-earth metals. Why should I quarrel with him if I intend, after peace is concluded, to trade and jointly develop those unique deposits? And besides: my personal friendly relationship with the Bully is the key to future peace in the Sandbox.

(Pause.)

**RED CAP:**

— As for you three — I have major grievances with you! Do you think I’ll save you when the Bully attacks you? Don’t even hope. Enough of freeloading off me! You’re big boys and must learn to defend yourselves. You need to increase your defense spending to 5 percent of your GDP. That’s an order!
And stop this idiotic immigration! Just look at yourselves in the mirror, see what you’ve become. Where has all your aristocratic bearing, your moral values, your faith gone? You’re destroying your own identity with your own hands. If things continue like this — our friendship will be over!


**ACT 5**

The Same Characters

**RED CAP:**

— So, to summarize. The thirteenth round of talks was sabotaged by the Jew — forcing me to kick him out of the Oval Office. The fourteenth round was sabotaged by the Bully, because, apparently, his plane number one got lost in a labyrinth of clouds.

**BULLY** (casually):

— That’s exactly what happened — the Jew disabled all my navigation systems!

**RED CAP:**

— Fine, whatever! Let’s schedule a date for the next round. And no more nonsense! I propose next Thursday.

**JEW**:

— Won’t work for me — I have Shabbat.

**RED CAP:**

— Then Friday.

**BULLY:**

— Christ was crucified on a Friday.

**RED CAP:**

— Then Saturday, Sunday, Monday...

**BULLY** (shaking his head negatively):

— A three-day mourning period has been declared nationwide...

**RED CAP** (furious):

— Then today! Now! This minute!
I demand that you make peace! Sit down at the negotiating table!

(Red Cap pulls out a folding table and two chairs from behind his back.)

**RED CAP:**

— My pleasure! Have a seat!

**BULLY**:

— Well, now! My chair has gone missing. This is direct sabotage of the negotiation process. I can’t negotiate standing up!

**JEW**:

— And a leg broke off my chair! It’s all the Bully, his tricks!

(Waves a chair leg in the air.)

**RED CAP** (wearily, with a martyred expression):

— The fifteenth round of negotiations is concluded. The dialogue was productive but difficult. We eagerly await the next meeting. There’s a good chance of reaching an agreement before Thanksgiving.

## 62. OUTRAGEOUS!  ENEMIES PLUNDERING  RUSSIAN LANGUAGE!

![](Images/En_Album_62.jpg)

Russia, Moscow, the Kremlin. Meeting of Russian Security Council. Russian President Vladimir Putin speaking.

**Putin:**

— Comrades! 

Today is a momentous day. Today, we have identified and formulated our third — and most important — goal of the Special Military Operation. Thus, from this moment on, I ask you to memorize our three strategic goals in the fight against the fascist Ukrainian regime:

 • Demilitarization

 • Denazification

 • Decolonization (of the Russian language)

Comrades!

It is with deep sorrow that I inform you: we have been struck by a catastrophe of cosmic proportions. For centuries, the enemy has been weaving a deadly web behind our backs, insidiously and secretly, and now we have found ourselves caught in it — completely unexpectedly.

Comrades!

We pay the utmost attention to protecting our spiritual and family values. This is wonderful! However, we have completely lost sight of our traditional communicational values. Both semantic and phonetic.

After all, our language — our national treasure — has for centuries  been subjected to predatory raids by the Ukrainian language! They steal our traditional, primordial Russian words, mutilate them by changing their phonetic form and semantics, and use them in their language without our consent!

They have stolen our prefixes and endings; they have stolen our nouns, adjectives, and verbs. They radically change their meaning; they mangle their pronunciation. This is a violation of the copyright of our intellectual property! We gave them no permission to do that. This is a criminal offense and grounds for compensation.

But it is also a desecration of the Russian language. It is genocide of our linguistic heritage. It is a humiliating spit in our souls.

Comrades! 

Before me lies a three-volume work compiled by our chief linguist and renowned expert on the Russian language — Vladimir Dal. It contains all the original Russian words stolen from our language by the Ukrainians — words that have been humiliated and insulted, turned into speechless slaves in the service of the communications of the Ukrainian fascist mob.

I do not wish to be unsubstantiated, comrades. I will give you dozens of examples of how our noble, authentic Russian words have been rudely and unceremoniously raped, violated, and forced into the alien structure of the so-called Ukrainian language.

• Take the Russian word ***ubit'*** (to kill). They snatched it and turned it into ***vbiti***. This is a discredit: one can vbit' (drive) a nail into a board, but fascists are to be killed (ubit').

• Take the Russian word ***tol'ko*** (only). They turned it into ***til'ky***.To a Russian ear, it sounds offensive. Furthermore, it's noteworthy that they use the hostile NATO letter **i** here. With a dot! Completely alien to our intellectual values. Did you know that there is an even more vile letter in the Ukrainian language: **ï**, with two dots! It is a clear symbol of degradation and the quintessence of fascist rhetoric.

• Take the Russian word ***chelovek*** (person). They turned it into ***cholovik***, and on top of that, they changed its meaning. According to their twisted logic, only men belong to the category of "people." That is, women are not people? This discredits the entire female half of humanity. What disrespect for Russian women!

• Take the Russian word ***narushat'*** (to violate). They changed everything in it: the prefix, the suffix, the ending. What did they get? A disgusting hybrid: ***porushuvaty***. This is an insult to the feelings of those who believe in the beauty and grandeur of the Russian language.

• Take the Russian word ***laska*** (caress). Kind, sweet, innocent, and warm. They have put it to use in the service of blatant propaganda for sexual games and debauchery! Just look at it! ***Bud' laska!*** For them, this supposedly means ***please***. "Bud' laska, go to the store." "Bud' laska, make an omelet." And so on. Every minute we hear this ***bud' laska***. But it is nothing more than an invitation to sexual foreplay: 

***bud' laska = caress me!***

This is sexual harassment in its purest form!

• And what about the word ***shkodit'*** ? We know that it means very bad behaviour. But they stole it and — to annoy us — elevated and refined it. For them, it means ***to damage***: "Do not ***poshkod'*** the bag!" How are we supposed to take this? This is discrediting of our very meanings, comrades. Sacred meanings.

What don't they do with our words!

• They rearrange letters in historically established combinations: we say ***rozhdayetsya*** (is born), they say ***narodzhuyetsya***. We have **zhd** they have **dzh**. This is a pure mockery of our language.

 • We say ***vsyo*** (all/everything), they say ***usyo***.

 • We say ***ulitsa*** (street), they say ***vulytsya***.

•  We say ***krestit'sya*** (to cross oneself), they say ***khrestytysya***. They are simply mimicking us! Like monkeys in a zoo.

•  And the good old word ***kakoy-nibud'*** (any/some)? They simply mutilated it! They castrated it and swapped the parts of the compound word. What did they get? Gibberish, abracadabra: ***bud'-yakiy***.

And so on and so forth. I repeat, I have in my hands three thick volumes listing all crimes of this nature.

We turned to experts, who came to the conclusion that this phenomenon is nothing less than the colonization of the Russian language with the aim of discrediting, humiliating, parodying, abusing, insulting, causing serious damage to its structural elements and, ultimately, destroying it.

Therefore, comrades, a new task stands before us. After four years of selfless struggle, we have achieved the goals of demilitarization and denazification of the so-called Ukraine. Now we are faced with an equally important task — the decolonization of the Russian language.

We must wrest our desecrated words from the clutches of the fascists, return them to their native harbor, and rehabilitate them.

And we are filing a counterclaim against Ukraine in the International Tribunal for compensation for reputational and linguistic damage. You want to use our words?  Obtain written permission and pay royalties. But we will not tolerate any violence, abuse, or disrespect for our linguistic symbols and their sacred meaning.

**Security Council Secretary N. Patrushev:**

— Vladimir Vladimirovich! I propose that we offer the opposing side a mutual settlement of our claim and  Ukraine's claim against Russia for material damage from military actions. We will demand compensation for the same amount — 800 billion euros.

**Putin:**

— Very good suggestion! Thank you! Thus, we win twice. We razed to the ground half of their country, but at the same time we do not pay a penny in reparations.

 ## 63. FUNDAMENTAL FOUNDATIONS OF PROPAGANDA

![](Images/En_Album_63.jpg)

Russia, Moscow, the Kremlin. Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses journalists of the Kremlin press pool.

**Putin**: 

— Comrades! Today, I would like to touch upon the bedrock principles of Russian state ideology. Our enemies accuse us of — how shall I put it —distorting ideas and facts, of turning concepts, principles, and faith upside down. In the public sphere, the term "mendacious propaganda" is frequently leveled against us.

This is unjust, comrades. It is a blatant lie and a baseless insinuation. We invent nothing, and we shall tolerate no "creative ad-libbing". Our ideology is based on a strictly scientific approach. Much like Marxism-Leninism, our ideology flows logically from the world-renowned theories of the greatest thinkers of human civilization.

If the three pillars of Communist teaching were Marx, Engels, and Lenin, then the three pillars of our ideology are Hegel, Einstein, and Orwell.

Dialectics and the Theory of Relativity provide the scientific basis for the structural framework of our ideology. The novel "1984" is a brilliant example of the substantive application of that very structure.

Our world rests upon fundamental laws:

• Universal Gravitation

• Unity and Struggle of Opposites (Hegel)

• General Theory of Relativity (Einstein)

Yes, dear comrades, everything in this world is relative: good and evil are intertwined; antagonists live in symbiosis. Read your Hegel. Remember your Einstein.

Take, for instance, war and peace. The brilliant visionary Orwell was the first to uncover the immutable truth: 

**PEACE IS WAR, WAR IS PEACE**

And indeed, look: there is currently peace between NATO and Russia. For now. I repeat: for now. But what is happening in reality? In reality, a full-scale hybrid war is underway (cyber-attacks, a war of ideas and meanings, draconian economic sanctions, the freezing of our financial assets, and so on). And this is what you call "peace"? I must specifically note the overtly hostile practice of regular NATO weapon deliveries to Ukraine. If NATO "HIMARS", even if launched from Ukraine, have decimated dozens of my strategically vital oil refineries — does that, in your view, qualify as peace?

On the other hand, conventional wars are peace in its embryonic stage. War leads nations to peace. Give people war, and they will immediately become ardent adherents of peace. War begets peace. No one desires peace more than the soldiers sitting in the trenches. These soldiers are not fighting for territory — they are fighting for peace. And the more brutal, bloody, and destructive a war becomes, the more solid and indestructible the peace born of that war will be. 

**WAR IS PEACE**, comrades. This is a fact. And it is a fact that must be reckoned with.

Another of Orwell’s brilliant discoveries is the axiom:

**TRUTH IS A LIE**

Indeed, the statement of any fact is subjective. Everything depends on the speaker’s point of view, on interpretation, and ultimately — on the definition of concepts. But conceptual frameworks can (and must!) differ across various cultures. 

For example, Europe has its own notions of duty, morality, and spiritual values; we have ours. By virtue of this alone, we cannot share the same interpretation of facts. What they call the truth is, for us, a lie. And vice versa. It is self-evident.

As for the so-called "rewriting" of history: this too is obvious, comrades. Scientific and technological progress is fundamentally changing our lives, our perceptions, and our views — changing them right before our eyes. We now have dozens of times more information at our disposal than we did, say, ten years ago. Artificial Intelligence offers immense opportunities for a more adequate analysis and understanding of history. Because of this, we must, of course, adapt textbooks for students and schoolchildren. This is the natural consequence of the total informatization of the society in which we live.

Furthermore, the dialectical approach leads us to the recognition of an obvious truth: 

**DEFENSE IS OFFENSE**

Take, for example, our heroic Special Military Operation. Yes, today it is already a full-fledged war. A war for peace throughout the world. But let us recall how it all began. NATO was openly preparing an invasion of our country by the Ukrainian army. If we had not entered the territory of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, we would be defending ourselves against the enemy on our own soil right now. We acted wisely — we delivered a preemptive retaliatory strike. In doing so, we saved thousands of lives and hundreds of civilian facilities from death and destruction. As you can see: 

**OFFENSE IS DEFENSE**

In its purest form.

And so, comrades, let us summarize. The most important front of our confrontation with the West is the ideological one. In your professional activities, you must not only disavow enemy propaganda — you must be able to prove to the electorate the scientific validity of our state ideology. I have provided you with several compelling examples. This is the foundation, which you may develop and deepen indefinitely.

To work, comrades! 

Victory will be ours!

## 64. PUTIN’S HANDBOOK

![](Images/All_Album_64.jpg)

Russia, Moscow, the Kremlin. Meeting of the heads of state security and law enforcement agencies. President of Russia Vladimir Putin speaking.

**Putin**: 

— Comrades! Who among you has read the seminal work of the great British writer **George Orwell**, "**1984**"? No one? You should. It is our handbook.

Dear comrade Orwell described a fairly effective totalitarian system of government. Of course, in the middle of the last century, he couldn't have even dreamed of the technologies we have at our disposal today. Because of this, his system is quite cumbersome, resource-heavy, and expensive. But regardless — it works perfectly! Even in conditions of technological backwardness.

But the main thing, comrades, is his immortal totalitarian ideas: ***doublethink***, the ***mutability of the past***, and the ***thought police***.

We have already adopted some things from his system and are applying them with great success. But, as they say, there is still room for improvement.

First and foremost, we must introduce the concept of ***thoughtcrime*** into our jurisprudence. This concept follows logically from our traditional values. Remember what Christ said in his sermons: if you have lusted after your brother’s wife, you have already committed adultery. Thus, according to the dogmas of our Orthodox Christian Church, the very thought of sin becomes a sin. This is an important metaphysical leap that we are simply duty-bound to put at the service of our state security.

So, we didn't invent ***thoughtcrime***, and neither did Orwell — it was invented by Lord God Himself.

What does this mean for us in practice?
First: a special unit must appear within the police — Thought Purity Department. Put simply, that very Orwellian ***Thought Police***.

Second: we must refine our criminal and administrative codes by introducing punishments for ***thoughtcrime***.
And most importantly — we must launch practical work among the population.

Let’s turn back to our handbook. In the mythical country of Oceania, dissenters were identified by establishing 24-hour surveillance over citizens using so-called ***telescreens***. Unlike Oceania, which, as I understand, had the status of a pariah on the international stage, Russia is one of the major geopolitical players and must maintain at least some semblance of basic decency. Therefore, we cannot openly violate such fundamental civil rights as the right to privacy.

Furthermore, ***telescreens*** are effective tools of intimidation, but uncovering secret thoughts requires clandestine methods. No one will confess to heresy if they know they are being monitored.

We have already taken a large — a huge — step in this direction: we developed and implemented the mandatory messenger MAX, which allows us to covertly monitor our citizens' communications. 

But! When a foreign agent goes to a protest, stands in a solo picket, or publishes unpatriotic appeals on the internet — that is already an advanced stage of ideological deviation. That can no longer be cured; it can only be punished with imprisonment.

In fact, you know, I suggest viewing dissent as a progressive disease. If we manage to diagnose it at an early stage, there is a very good chance that, with the help of basic corrective procedures, we can cure a person of this illness forever.

Therefore — our attention must be directed primarily at children. Yes, our "Talks about the Important things" are already standard practice across the country. This is wonderful — we are instilling the correct mindsets in our children. But we need feedback! What do we have in this regard? Student surveys? They are absolutely ineffective; it’s like expecting a foreign agent to confess in front of a ***telescreen***.

We need a systemic, global solution. And it lies right on the surface. What will we do? We will install 24-hour audio surveillance in kindergartens, schools, and other educational institutions. Not video surveillance — no. That is expensive and unnecessary. We don’t need faces — only conversations and a voice recognition system. This is simpler and cheaper. And it can be done covertly.

Next, artificial intelligence analyzes the information coming to the server and produces the final result: "Petya Belkin from 3rd grade at School No. 212 is unreliable; yesterday during the break between the second and third lessons, he used an insulting remark directed at the President."

Petya is then handled by the juvenile department for painless ideological correction — much like the way a child’s teeth are straightened with braces when they grow in sideways.
And exactly like crooked teeth — in childhood, such ideological correction is still possible.

And by the way, when little Petya grows up, he will only be grateful to us for helping him get rid of wrong thoughts in his childhood and thereby saving him from prison.

Naturally, total audio surveillance should be carried out in all state institutions — we are not breaking any laws there. In coordination with private business owners, we will also install monitoring devices on their premises and in their offices. If they refuse to cooperate — well, you know how to persuade them.

Our ultimate goal, comrades, is to build a harmonious society — a society based on the principles of homogeneity, conformity, solidarity, and cohesion.

So that I no longer have to lie during a "Direct Line" with the people, claiming that foreign agents in Russia are not subject to criminal prosecution.

We won’t actually have to persecute dissenters — for the simple reason that we won’t have any dissenters left.
