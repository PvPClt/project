# ABOUT THE AUTHOR AND THE CONDITIONS OF THE PROJECT’S CREATION

1. Flight and Denial of Asylum In April 2024, at the age of 66, I was forced to flee Russia to escape persecution. In September of the same year, I applied for asylum in Switzerland, providing evidence that my return to Russia was impossible.

However, the consideration of my case was accompanied by gross procedural violations: I was not provided with an adequate translation of the Interview Protocol, my answers were distorted by the translator, and my key evidence was ignored by the SEM (State Secretariat for Migration). The Decision was based on fabricated circumstances and false "facts"; a scheduled medical examination was cancelled without explanation. As a result, I received an unsubstantiated denial of asylum and was deported to Georgia, where I found myself in the midst of a humanitarian catastrophe.

2. Survival Conditions For almost two years, I, a 68-year-old woman alone, have been living in a tent on the street, without access to basic human living conditions:

• Cold: At night, the temperature in the tent drops below zero degrees Celsius.

• Lack of Medicine and Hygiene: No possibility of receiving medical treatment, washing, or doing laundry.

• Minimal Resources: Food consists of dry rations and ice-cold water; there is no electricity, heating, air conditioning, or refrigerator (no conditions for storing medicine); I am unable to purchase gas, winter gear, or warm clothes and shoes.

3. Systematic Pressure and Persecution My situation is not just a lack of housing. I face constant harassment and hostility that make survival practically impossible: damage to property (tent, air mattress, bicycle), systematic night-time noise, threats and intimidation, physical harm to my health, and hacking attacks on my smartphone.

The most horrific act of pressure was the news received in October 2025 of my mother’s sudden death in Russia, which I regard as part of an intimidation campaign.

4. Creativity as an Act of Resistance and Help This entire system of pressure has one goal: to silence me and force me back to Russia. And that is exactly why I do not remain silent and continue to live in unbearable conditions, despite everything.

My work as a writer, satirist, and artist, exposing the war and the Putin regime, is systematically blocked on all major Russian-language platforms (9 social networks and 2 literary portals). Total censorship is the best proof of the ideological value, significance, and relevance of my words.

This project is my response to those trying to destroy me. In conditions bordering on torture, I create texts in order to:

• Expose the endless flow of political madness, lawlessness, lies, cynicism, and cruelty.

• Direct the attention of the world community to the needs of those suffering from war and authoritarian regimes.

• Convert this attention into real help by encouraging readers to make direct donations to verified support funds for Ukraine.

Every miniature, play, or article you read is written at the cost of incredible effort: a Spartan life in a tent, amidst unbearable heat, cold, hunger, constant persecution, despair, and hopelessness. This is not just text. It is a testament to courage, unbreakable will, and active resistance. At the same time, it is a tool to help those like me—the suffering, the dispossessed, and the desperate.

I have no means to improve my living (survival) conditions in any way. But I can create meaning. Let us help these meanings find their way to those who need them.
